Therefore, this course is being taught as an inverse\nclassroom, i.e., most of the class time you will work on practical\nassignments. Additional assignments will be given as homework.\n\nYou should expect to spend considerable time trying to figure why your\ncode produces error messages, or why it produces unexpected\nresults.
