Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams.
During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world.
In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.

He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide 
public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space 
Shuttle Challenger disaster. 
Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field 
of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. 
He held the Richard C. 
Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.
