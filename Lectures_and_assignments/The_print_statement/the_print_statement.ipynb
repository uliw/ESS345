Here a \nsummary. If any of these are unclear, please go back to the previous\nmodules and talk to your TA/Prof. where necessary.\n\n1.  While python understands decimal numbers without help, we have to\n    mark strings with quotation marks (otherwise python would think it is a variable or function name): `s = \"Hello World\"`\n2.  It matters how we use brackets:\n    -   Square brackets to the right of an equal sign indicate that you\n        declare a list: `a = [1, 2, 4]`. Square brackets to the right\n        of a name or letter indicate an index expression: `a[1] =\n               22`. Index expressions can also be used to address ranges and\n        stepsize: `a[1:2:1]`.\n    -   Round brackets to the right of an equal sign are used to\n        declare a tuple: `t=(1, 2, 3)`, whereas round brackets to the\n        right of a name indicates that this name is a function:\n        `print()`. Note that to access the 2<sup>nd</sup> element of the\n        tuple, you will still have to use square brackets since you are\n        doing and index operation: `t[1]`\n    -   Curly braces to the right are used to declare a set: `u =\n               {1,2,3}`. Set members cannot be retrieved by an index operation\n    -   But they are also used to declare dictionaries. In this case,\n        the declaration contains key:value pairs that are separated by a colon. `d = {\"B\":12, \"A\":14, \"C\":7}. Dictionary entries can be retrieved by using an index expression suing the dictionary key: =d[\"B\"]`\n3.  A name followed by regular brackets denotes a python function:\n    `print()`. Functions exist independently of data (or objects like lists).\n4.  A name followed by a dot and another name with brackets denotes\n    an object method: `a.sort()` which only exists as long as the\n    object exists.\n    -   Object methods can either modify the object associated data in\n        place, e.g., `a.sort()`\n    -   Or, they do not modify the object associated data, but instead\n        return a copy of the data, e.g., `s.split(\",\")`. So if you\n        would like to change the original data set, you would have to\n        write `s = s.split(\",\")`.\n5.  We can query the object type with the type function: `type(a)`,\n    we can list the object associated methods with the dir function:\n    `dir(a)`\n6.  We can get help on python functions with the help command:\n    `help(print)`\n7.  We can get help on object methods with the help function:\n    =help(a.pop)\n8.  The expression `b = a` does not copy the data of a to b. It only\n    copies the object reference. So and b share the same data. I.e.,\n    if you modify `a`, you also modify `b`.  To get an independent\n    copy of `a` you need to explicitly copy the data: `b = a.copy()`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Using print()\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["  By now, you probably\nnoticed that the print statement is a function. Functions\n  usually take one\nor more arguments (i.e., data or variables), which are enclosed by\nregular brackets, and then do something with that data. We use the\nprint function so far, simply to echo the value of a variable back\nonto the screen. There is however, much more we can do with this\nfunction, and we will make extensive use of this capability. This\nmodule will teach the basics of producing formatted\noutput.  \n\nMost things python are straightforward, but the syntax of the print\nfunction is not. This is simply because every new python version\nprovides new ways to format the print output. In this course, we will\nuse the syntax provided by python 3.7, the so-called f-strings. You\nwill note that this is different from the syntax explained in your\nbook or what you will find on legacy systems, which may still run\npython 2.7. If you run into these cases, the internet is your friend.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### F-strings\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" \n  We\nalready came across the =print() statement, which allows us to display\nthe value of a variable.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"# Out [1]: \n# output\n8"}],"source":["a = 2\nb = 4\nc = a * b\nprint(c)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["this is handy enough while you develop your code, but it would be nice\nif could print something more meaningful, e.g., \"The square-root of 12 equals 4\".\n\nIn other words, we need a way to mix strings with variable\nvalues.
