{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Recap\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Over the course of the last couple of modules, we implicitly learned\n(hopefully), a couple of important things about python. Here a short\nsummary. If any of these are unclear, please go back to the previous\nmodules and talk to your TA/Prof. where necessary.\n\n1.  While python understands decimal numbers without help, we have to\n    mark strings with quotation marks (otherwise python would think\n    it is variable or function name): `s = \"Hello World\"`\n2.  It really matters how we use brackets:\n    -   Square brackets to the right of an equal sign indicate that you\n        declare a list: `a = [1, 2, 4]`. Square brackets to the right\n        of a name or letter indicate an index expression: `a[1] =\n               22`. Index expressions can also be used to address ranges and\n        stepsize: `a[1:2:1]`.\n    -   Round brackets to the right of an equal sign are used to\n        declare a tuple: `t=(1, 2, 3)`, whereas round brackets to the\n        right of a name indicate that this name is a function:\n        `print()`. Note that in order to access the 2<sup>nd</sup> elemnt of the\n        tuple, you will still have to use square brackets since you are\n        doing and index operation: `t[1]`\n    -   Curly braces to the right are used to declare a set: `u =\n               {1,2,3}`. Set members cannot be retrieved by an index operation\n    -   But they are also used to declare dictionaries. In this case,\n        the declaration contains key:value pairs which are separated by\n        a colon. =d = {\"B\":12, \"A\":14, \"C\":7}. Dictionary entries can\n        be retrieved by using and index expression suing the dictionary\n        key: `d[\"B\"]`\n3.  A name followed by regular brackets denotes a python function:\n    `print()`. Functions exist independent of data (or objects like\n    lists).\n4.  A name followed by a dot and another name with brackets, denotes\n    an object method: `a.sort()` which only exists as along as the\n    object exists.\n    -   Object methods can either modify the object associated data in\n        place, e.g., `a.sort()`\n    -   Or, they do not modify the object associated data, but instead\n        return a copy of the data, e.g., `s.split(\",\")`. So if you\n        would like to change the original data set, you would have to\n        write `s = s.split(\",\")`.\n5.  We can query the object type with the type function: `type(a)`,\n    we can list the object associated methods with the dir function:\n    `dir(a)`\n6.  We can get help on python functions with the help command:\n    `help(print)`\n7.  We can get help on object methods with the help function:\n    =help(a.pop)\n8.  The expression `b = a` does not copy the data of a to b. It only\n    copies the object reference. So and b share the same data. I.e.,\n    if you modify `a`, you also modify `b`.  To get an independent\n    copy of `a` you need to explicitly copy the data: `b = a.copy()`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## The print function\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["By now, you probably noticed that the print statement is a\nfunction. Functions usually take one or more arguments (i.e., data, or\nvariables) which are enclosed by regular brackets, and then do\nsomething with that data. We use the print function so far, simply to\necho the value of a variable back onto the screen. There is however\nmuch more we can do with this function, and we will make extensive use\nof this capability. This module will teach the basics of producing\nformatted output.\n\nMost things python are straightforward, but the syntax of the print\nfunction is not. This is simply because every new python version\nprovides new ways to format the print output. In this course, we will\nuse the syntax provided by python 3.7, the so called f-strings. You\nwill note that this is different from the syntax explained in your\nbook, or what you will find on legacy systems which may still run\npython 2.7.
