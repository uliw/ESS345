    "1.  While python understands decimal numbers without help, we have to\n",
    "    mark strings with quotation marks (otherwise python would think it is a variable or function name): `s = \"Hello World\"`\n",
    "2.  It matters how we use brackets:\n",
    "    -   Square brackets to the right of an equal sign indicate that you\n",
    "        declare a list: `a = [1, 2, 4]`. Square brackets to the right\n",
    "        of a name or letter indicate an index expression: `a[1] =\n",
    "               22`. Index expressions can also be used to address ranges and\n",
    "        stepsize: `a[1:2:1]`.\n",
    "    -   Round brackets to the right of an equal sign are used to\n",
    "        declare a tuple: `t=(1, 2, 3)`, whereas round brackets to the\n",
    "        right of a name indicates that this name is a function:\n",
    "        `print()`. Note that to access the 2<sup>nd</sup> element of the\n",
    "        tuple, you will still have to use square brackets since you are\n",
    "        doing and index operation: `t[1]`\n",
    "    -   Curly braces to the right are used to declare a set: `u =\n",
    "               {1,2,3}`. Set members cannot be retrieved by an index operation\n",
    "    -   But they are also used to declare dictionaries. In this case,\n",
    "        the declaration contains key:value pairs that are separated by a colon. `d = {\"B\":12, \"A\":14, \"C\":7}. Dictionary entries can be retrieved by using an index expression suing the dictionary key: =d[\"B\"]`\n",
    "3.  A name followed by regular brackets denotes a python function:\n",
    "    `print()`. Functions exist independently of data (or objects like lists).\n",
    "4.  A name followed by a dot and another name with brackets denotes\n",
    "    an object method: `a.sort()` which only exists as long as the\n",
    "    object exists.\n",
    "    -   Object methods can either modify the object associated data in\n",

    "        would like to change the original data set, you would have to\n",
    "        write `s = s.split(\",\")`.\n",

    "    =help(a.pop)\n",
