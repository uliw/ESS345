Set a = to 12 and then write a python statement in such a way that\n    you get the following output (1pt).\n    \n        The value of the variable a = 12\n    \n    Note, I don't want you to type\n     a string with these words. Use an f-string and use the appropriate\n     syntax so that the actual value of a is printed.\n\n2.  Using the same code as above, include linefeed statements in such a\n    way that your printout is preceded and followed by an empty line (1pt).\n\n3.  Using the same code as in 2, precede and follow the empty lines\n    with 40 dashes (see below). Note that rather than typing (and\n    counting) use this statement `'-'*40`. Your result should look like\n    this - including the empty lines. (1pt).\n    \n        ----------------------------------------\n        \n        The value of the variable a =\n        \n        ----------------------------------------\n\n4.  Modify the first and last print statement (not the tuple) in such a\n    way that you get this (1pt)\n    \n        *----------------------------------------*\n        \n        The value of the variable a =\n        \n        *----------------------------------------*\n\n5.  Using the code in 4, add an escape sequence in front of \"The\n    value&#x2026;\", so that this line is displayed with one tab to the\n    right. (1pt)\n\n6.  You are working on software for a point of sale system (i.e., cash\n    register). Your software knows about the sales price, as well as\n    how much cash you received from the customer. Write some python\n    code which calculates and displays the change owed. Your display\n    should read:\n    \n        Change owed = $12.40\n    \n    Notes: A) You code should correctly round the owed amount to the\n    nearest 10 cents, and display the cents as in the above example; B)\n    You should achieve this by using the appropriate format modifier\n    and by making good use of the f-string. Assume that the customer\n    provided a $20 dollar bill, and that the price was $7.63. Also, test\n    your code with a price of $7.67. (4pts)\n\n7.  Using the example in #6: Rather than printing the change owed,\n    print a proper receipt. Towards this end, add a variable which\n    describes the item. Your output should look like this (note that\n    the dollar signs should all be aligned &#x2013; see the pdf version if in\n    doubt)\n    \n        Cheese        $7.63\n        HST           $\n        -------------------\n        Total         $\n        \n        Paid          $\n        Change owed = $\n    \n    Notes: A) you first need to calculate the HST (13%) B) The dollar\n    sign of the price should be two tab stops to the right. The length\n    of the item description should be limited in such a way that it\n    leaves at least one blank between the item string and the\n    price. Test this by setting `item = \"This is a really long time\n       name\"`. (5 pts)\n\n8.  The two statements below are fairly similar, yet, the result of the\n    print statement is rather different(execute this to see for\n    yourself).\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = (\n    f\"This is string one\\n\"\n    f\"This is string two\\n\"\n    f\"This is string three\\n\"\n    )\n\nb = (\n    f\"This is string one\\n\",\n    f\"This is string two\\n\",\n    f\"This is string three\\n\"\n    )\n\nprint(a)\nprint(b)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Explain why is this happening?
