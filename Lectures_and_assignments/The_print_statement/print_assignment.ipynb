Set a = to 12 and than write a python statement in such a way that you get the following output (1pt).\n    \n        The value of the variable a =\n\n2.  Using the same code as above, include linefeed statements in such a\n    way that your printout is preceded and followed by an empty line (1pt).\n\n3.  Using the same code as in 2, precede and follow the empty lines\n    with 40 dashes (see below). Note, that rather than typing (and\n    counting) 40 dashes declare a tuple with a single dash and than\n    multiply it 40 times (not sure this is proper style, but it\n    works). Your result should look like this (1pt).\n    \n        ----------------------------------------\n        \n        The value of the variable a =\n        \n        ----------------------------------------\n\n4.  Modify the first and last print statement (not the tuple) in such a\n    way that you get this (1pt)\n    \n        *----------------------------------------*\n        \n        The value of the variable a =\n        \n        *----------------------------------------*\n\n5.  Using the code in 4, add an escape sequence in front of \"The\n    value&#x2026;\", so that this line is displayed with one tab to the\n    right. (1pt)\n\n6.  You are working on software for a point of sale system (i.e., cash\n    register). Your software knows about the sales price, as well as\n    how much cash you received from the customer. Write some python\n    code which calculates and displays the change owed. Your display\n    should read e.g.,\n    \n        Change owed = $12.40\n    \n    Notes: A) You code should correctly round the owed amount to the\n    nearest 10 cents, and display the cents as in the above example; B)\n    You should achieve this by using the appropriate format modifier\n    and by making good use of the f-string. Assume that the customer\n    provided a $20 dollar bill, and that the price was $7.63. Also test\n    you code with a price of $7.67. (4pts)\n\n7.  Using you code from 6) add code in such a way that you also\n    calculate HST on the price. (1pt)\n\n8.  Using you code from 7: Rather than printing the change owed, print\n    a proper receipt. Towards this end add a variable which describes\n    the item. Your output should look like this:\n    \n        Cheese        $7.63\n        HST           $\n        -------------------\n        Total         $\n        \n        Paid          $\n        Change owed = $\n    \n    Note, the dollar sign of the price should be two tab stops to the\n    right. The length of the item description should be limited in such\n    a way that it leaves at least one blank between the item string and\n    the price. Test this by setting `item = \"This is a really long time\n       name\"`. (4pts)\n\n9.  The two statements below are fairly similar, yet, the result of the\n    print statement is rather different(execute this to see for\n    yourself). Why is this happening? Note, I am not asking that one\n    expression has commas, whereas the other has not. I am asking what\n    difference does the comma make?
