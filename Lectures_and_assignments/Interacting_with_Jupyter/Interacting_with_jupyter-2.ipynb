This indicates that the cell has been selected.\n\nIf you double left click on the cell, you will see that the cell\nbackground changes to gray, and the text will be rendered in a\ntypewriter font.

This is done with a\nfew simple commands using the \"Markdown Syntax\". Try this with the\nchapter heading, and with the heading of this paragraph, and you will\nsee that the level of the heading is determined by the number of\nhashtags in front of the heading text. Remember that you leave the\nedit mode by hitting `shift + enter`.\n\nDouble click on this cell to see some typical elements:\n\n1.  This is **bold** text\n2.  This is a simple list\n    -   First list entry\n    -   Second list entry\n3.  This is the 3rd entry in the enumerated list and has no other\n    purpose than just being the 3rd entry.\n\nYou may have noted that the list nesting is achieved by merely\nindenting the text after \"This is a simple list\". There are many more\nformatting options, but for this course, we likely won't need them,\nbut feel free to have a look at [this link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Adding Code cells\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Add a code cello below your personal information and enter a trivial\nstatement like `1 + 1` and hit `shift-enter` and you should see the\nresult being displayed below the code cell (hopefully it is 2).
