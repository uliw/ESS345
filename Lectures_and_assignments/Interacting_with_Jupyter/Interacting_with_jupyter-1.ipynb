A text editor which allows us to write computer code.\n2.  Some sort of program which executes our code\n3.  And a way to see the results of our code\n\nThere are many way to achieve the above, but typically most people use\nwhat is commonly referred to as an \"Integrated Development\nEnvironment\" or IDE. There is an enormous variety of IDE's available,\nbut most require a local installation. For the purpose of this course\nWe will use a web-based IDE, which is called `Jupyter`.  Which is\nwidely used in the sciences as well as in the business environment.\n\nIn this unit we you will learn:\n\n1.  How to access a Jupyter server\n2.  How to open a Jupyter notebook\n3.  How to execute programming statements in a Jupyter notebook\n4.  How to save a  Jupyter notebook\n5.  How to download a  Jupyter notebook\n\nJupyter servers can run locally on you computer, are available\ncommercially for a fee, and some are even available for free\n(e.g. googles colab). For this course, we will use a Jupyter server\nwhich is provided by Compute Canada, and can be accessed with your\nUtorid.\n\nSo without further ado, follow this link [https://utoronto.syzygy.ca](https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fuliw%2FESS345&urlpath=tree%2FESS345%2F)\nand use your Utorid to log in.\n\nAfter logging in, the system will download the course files from a\nserver, and than you should see the following\n\n![img](screen1.png \"The home screen of your Jupyter session. Note that yours might look slightly different.\")\n\nFor now, don't click on anything, but lets have a look around. If you\nare unable to see any of the following elements, ask your neighbor, or\nspeak up!\n\nYou can see the Jupyter label in the top right corner, the `Logout` and\n`Control Panel` buttons in the top right corner. Next come a line with\ntabs for `Files`, `Running`, `Clusters`, followed by a line with\nbuttons for `Upload`, `New`, and `Reload`.  This is followed by a table.\n\nThe table header starts with a button which lets you select all files,\nor only specific file types. Next comes the blue breadcrumb which\nindicates your position in the file system tree. It should read\n`ESS345`. The next button lets you sort the table by `Name`, the date\nwhen the file was `Last Modified`, or the `File Size`.\n\nThe table rows contain a variety of entries, where each entry type is\nsignified by a different icon. \n\n1.  The first one is a folder symbol with no name, but 2 dots. This\n    symbol represent the folder which contains the `ESS345` folder\n    (i.e., one up).\n2.  This is followed by a couple of folders\n3.  A green icon, with the text \"syllabus-2019.ipynb\". These are the\n    Jupyter notebooks we will do most of our work with\n4.  A paper symbol with the text \"LICENSE\". This icon denotes a text file.\n5.  A text file called \"README.md\" which contains a short text\n    explaining the contents of this folder. The extension `.md` says\n    that this file is formatted in the markdown language.\n\nLet see what we can do here:\n\n1.  Click on the `LICENSE` file, which should open a new window showing\n    unformatted text. Close this window and click on the README.md\n    file. Not much there, but you can see that the headline is in blue,\n    and that this text also contains active links (more on markdown\n    later). Close this window as well.\n\n2.  click on `my_submissions` which should take you to an empty\n    folder. Use the empty folder symbol to return back to the `ESS345`\n    folder.\n\n3.  click on my `my_stuff` and create a new directory by selecting the\n    `New` button in the upper right corner, and than select \"Folder\"\n    (the term folder and directory are used interchangeably). Mark this\n    new folder using the checkbox left of the folder name, and now\n    select the \"rename\" button in the upper right corner, and rename\n    this folder to \"test\"\n4.  Mark this directory and delete it.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## What you should have learned in this module\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["1.
