A text editor which allows us to write computer code.\n2.  Some sort of program which executes our code\n3.  And a way to see the results of our code\n\nThere are many way to achieve the above, but typically most people use\nwhat is commonly referred to as an \"Integrated Development\nEnvironment\" or IDE. There is an enormous variety of IDE's available,\nbut most require a local installation. For the purpose of this course\nWe will use a web-based IDE, which is called `Jupyter`.  Which is\nwidely used in the sciences as well as in the business environment.\n\nIn this unit we you will learn:\n\n1.  How to access a jupyter server\n2.  How to upload a jupyter notebook\n3.  How to execute programming statements in a jupyter notebook\n4.  How to save a  jupyter notebook\n5.  How to download a  jupyter notebook\n\nJupyter servers can run locally on you computer, are available\ncommercially for a fee, and some are even available for free\n(e.g. googles colab). For this course, we will use a Jupyter server\nwhich is provided by Compute Canada, and can be accessed with your\nutorid.\n\nSo without further ado, follow this link [https://utoronto.syzygy.ca](https://utoronto.syzygy.ca)\nand use your utorid to log in. With some luck, you will see something\nlike Fig.[14](#org1fd4f3c)\n\n![img](screen1.png \"The home screen of your Jupyter session. Note that yours will likely look different.\")\n\nLet's see what we can do Here:\n\n1.  Create a new directory by selecting the `New` button in the upper\n    right corner, and than select \"Folder\" (the term folder and\n    directory are used interchangeably). Mark this new folder using the\n    checkbox left of the folder name, and now select the \"rename\"\n    button in the upper right corner, and rename this folder to\n    \"ESS345\"\n2.  Click on this directory to open it, and now create a new directory\n    inside of \"ESS345\" which is called \"The-Jupyter-Interface\". Pay\n    attention to the dashes, and the absence of blanks!\n3.  Click on `The-Jupyter-Interface` folder to enter it.\n4.  Download the following two files on your computer:\n    1.  [https://drive.google.com/open?id=13KheVKW7ERyFH7xLNWVbSZVCs3hGqUhJ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13KheVKW7ERyFH7xLNWVbSZVCs3hGqUhJ)\n    2.

Next use the upload button in your Jupyter session to upload both\n    files into `The-Jupyter-Interface`\n6.  If all worked well, you can now click on your notebook, and open\n    it. It should contain the same text as this pdf file.\n\nIf this did not work, please speak up Now. \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Assignment\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["If it did work, \n\n1.
