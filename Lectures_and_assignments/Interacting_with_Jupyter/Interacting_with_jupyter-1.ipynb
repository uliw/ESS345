A text editor that allows us to write computer code.\n2.  Some program which executes our code\n3.  And a way to see the results of our code\n\nThere are many ways to achieve the above, but typically most people\nuse what is commonly referred to as an \"Integrated Development\nEnvironment\" or IDE. There is an enormous variety of IDE's available,\nbut most require a local installation. For this course, we will use a\nweb-based IDE, which is called `Jupyter`, which is widely used in the\nsciences as well as in business environments.\n\nIn this unit you will learn:\n\n1.  How to access a Jupyter server\n2.  How to open a Jupyter notebook\n\nJupyter servers can run locally on your computer, are available\ncommercially for a fee, and some are even available for free\n(e.g., googles colab). For this course, we will use a Jupyter server\nwhich is provided by Compute Canada, and can be accessed with your\nUTorID.\n\nThere are different ways to access your Jupyter account. In this\ncourse, we will use this somewhat lengthy URL:\n\n[https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https:/github.com/uliw/ESS345&urlpath=tree/ESS345](https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https:/github.com/uliw/ESS345&urlpath=tree/ESS345)\n\nif you look careful you see that the first part specifies the utoronto\njupyter server, which is followed by a redirect to a program called\ngit-pull with a references the github repository I use for the course\nmaterials. This will first authenticate you, them download or update\nthe course materials, and then start your jupyter interface.\n\nSo if you click on this link it should open a browser window with the\nlink (see Fig. [blink](#blink))\n\n![img](./Tianshi/TL-fig-001.png \"This is what you will briefly see in your browser status line\")\n\nand this will then take you to your UtorId login screen (Fig. [utorid](#utorid))\n\n![img](./Tianshi/TL-fig-002.png \"The UtorId login screen\")\n\nand finally you should see a screen like the one shown in\nFig. [fig-one](#fig-one) (but without the `My_Stuff` directory).\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_125640.png \"The home screen of your Jupyter session. Note that yours might look slightly different.\")\n\nFor now, don't click on anything, but let's have a look around. If you\nare unable to see any of the following elements, ask your neighbor, or\nspeak up!\n\nYou can see the Jupyter label in the top right corner, the `Logout` and\n`Control Panel` buttons in the top right corner. Next comes a line with\ntabs for `Files`, `Running`, `Clusters`, followed by a line with\nbuttons for `Upload`, `New`, and `Reload`.  This is followed by a table.\n\nThe table header starts with a button that lets you select all files\nor only specific file types. Next comes the blue breadcrumb, which\nindicates your position in the file system tree. It should read\n`ESS345`. The next button lets you sort the table by `Name`, the date\nwhen the file was `Last Modified`, or the `File Size`.\n\nThe table rows contain a variety of entries, where each entry type is\nsignified by a different icon. \n\n1.  The first one is a folder symbol with no name, but two dots. This\n    symbol represents the folder which contains the `ESS345` folder\n    (i.e., one up). If you click on it, you will go to your home\n    folder. You can return to the `ESS345` folder by clicking on the\n    `ESS345` folder symbol.\n2.  Once you are back in the `ESS345` folder, the next file you see is\n    the syllabus. This file shows the notebook icon, and also has the\n    `.ipynb` extension which denotes all jupyter notebooks. If the\n    notebook is open and active, this icon will be green, otherwise it\n    will be gray.\n3.  The next two icons show a paper symbol, which denotes a text\n    file. You can click on these files and read them. If you are done\n    reading, simply click on the jupyter icon in the upper left corner\n    to return back to the folder view.\n\nLet's make some changes:\n\n1.  go to your home directory (i.e. one up from ESS345) and in the\n    upper right corner, select `New` and `Folder` see\n    Fig. [nfolder](#nfolder)\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_124326.png \"Creating a new folder. Note that we do this from the home directory, i.e., one up from `ESS345`\")\n\n2.  This will create a new folder called `Untitled\n         Folder`. Select the check-mark left of the folder name, and then\n    click rename in the upper left corner, and rename the new folder\n    `My_Stuff`. Your screen should now look like Fig. [homed](#homed) This\n    new folder will hold all your own jupyter notebooks.\n\n![img](./figures/Screenshot_20200527_125640.png \"Your home directory should now look like this.\")\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Recap\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In this module, you should have learned:\n\n1.
