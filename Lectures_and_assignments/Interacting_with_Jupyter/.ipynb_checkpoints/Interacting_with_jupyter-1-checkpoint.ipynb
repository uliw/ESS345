    "To create a computer program, we need the following ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A text editor that allows us to write computer code.\n",
    "2.  Some program which executes our code\n",
    "3.  And a way to see the results of our code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to achieve the above, but typically most people use\n",
    "what is commonly referred to as an \"Integrated Development\n",
    "Environment\" or IDE. There is an enormous variety of IDE's available,\n",
    "but most require a local installation. For this course,\n",
    "we will use a web-based IDE, which is called `Jupyter`.  Which is\n",
    "widely used in the sciences as well as in the business environment.\n",

    "1.  How to access a Jupyter server\n",

    "Jupyter servers can run locally on your computer, are available\n",
    "commercially for a fee, and some are even available for free\n",

    "2.  This is followed by a couple of folders\n",
    "3.  A green icon, with the text \"syllabus-2019.ipynb\". These are the\n",
    "    Jupyter notebooks we will do most of our work with\n",
    "4.  A paper symbol with the text \"LICENSE\". This icon denotes a text file.\n",
    "5.  A text file called \"README.md\" which contains a short text\n",

    "1.  Click on the `LICENSE` file, which should open a new window showing\n",

    "    file. Not much there, but you can see that the headline is in blue\n",
    "    and that this text also contains active links (more on markdown\n",
    "    later). Close this window as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  click on `my_submissions` which should take you to an empty\n",

    "    folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  click on my `my_stuff` and create a new directory by selecting the\n",
    "    `New` button in the upper right corner, and then select \"Folder\"\n",
    "    (the term folder and directory are used interchangeably). Mark this\n",
