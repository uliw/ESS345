* Assignment 



** Learning Outcomes

 - create/delete/rename folders/files on your jupyter cloud account
 - create a jupyter notebook file
 - edit text inside your jupyter notebook
 - use markdown syntax to format notebook text elements

** Instructions:
Enough theory! Without further ado, let's create a new notebook of
your own. *Since all content in the ESS345 folder is downloaded from*
*another computer (and may thus be overwritten or deleted) we must
take* *care that our own notebooks are created outside of this
directory*.  If you have followed the previous instructions, you will
already have the =My_Stuff= directory in your root folder. If not,
please create it now. 

Click on this folder to enter it, and then create a new folder called
 =My_ESS345_Submissions=. Enter this folder, and left-click on the
 =New= button in the upper right corner. Select =Python 3= to create a
 new python notebook. Once the new notebook has opened, left-click on
 =File= and then select "Rename" and name your file according to the
 following Scheme

=FirstName-Lastname-text-edit-assignment=
So in my case, this should look like Fig. ref:name
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth
#+name: name
#+caption: You should see following, but make sure to use your own name
[[./figures/Screenshot_20200528_101944.png]]



In the middle of the menu bar, you will see the word =Code= just right
of the double right arrow. This box tells you that the first (and
currently empty cell) is a code box. You can change the cell type to
=Markdown= by left-clicking on =Code=, or by using the =Cell= menu.

1) Go ahead and change it to "Markdown"
2) Now add the following text to this cell: "ESS345 Computational Geology Text Cell Assignment"
4) Save your edits by hitting =shift+enter=
5) Select this cell again (double left click) and now modify the text
   using markdown syntax in such a way that it becomes a level 1
   heading (see above).
 
If you already have a new cell below the heading, change it to
markdown mode (see above), or insert a new cell 
(=Insert -> Cell below=) and change it to markdown afterward.

In this cell, add the following text
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Date: 

First Name:

Last Name:

Student ID:
#+END_EXAMPLE

Add the current date, your first and last name, and your student id
after the colon. Now change the formatting in such a way that the text
before the colon is set in bold, whereas your personal info is set in
a regular font.

This should look something like this
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth
#+name: name
#+caption: Formatting example for your notebook submission
[[./figures/Screenshot_20200921_111320.png]]

Follow the previous instructions and save your notebook, and download
it in =Notebook= and =pdf= format, and submit on Quercus.

** Last but not least

Review the learning outcomes above, and consider whether you feel
confident about all of them. If not, post your concerns on the
discussion board.

** Marking Scheme
 
1) 3 points if the filename follows the filename template (capitalization, spaces, and dashes!)
2) 2 points if the text content is as requested (one for content, one
   for layout)
