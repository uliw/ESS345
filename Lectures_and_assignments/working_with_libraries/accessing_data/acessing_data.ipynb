{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Working with libraries - an introduction\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" A python library is\nsimply a file which contains function definitions. The key, here, is\nthat this file contains only function definitions, and no other\nprogram code. The file must also be written in plain python, it can't\nbe in notebook format. This is no major inconvenience since most of\nthe time, we only want to use the functions in the file, rather than\nchanging them. Library development is hower best done with a full\nfledged python IDE (Integrated Development\nEnvironment). \n\nSo why would we want that?\n\n1.  Moving often used functions into a library declutters your code.\n2.  Python has myriads of libraries which greatly extend the\n    functionality of the language.\n3.  Another important reason why we prefer to use libraries (rather\n    than writing our own code) is that the developers of the\n    libraries usually spend more time in optimizing the performances\n    and improving the compatibilities of the code. Also, it we\n    encounter problems using public libraries, we often can find\n    solutions or helpful information on the Internet. In that sense,\n    by using the public libraries, we are collaborating with the\n    whole community.\n\nWhy you would not want to use a library:\n\n1.  Unless it's your own library, you depend on someone else. Imagine\n    this great library you found, but it has this nasty bug, and the\n    guy who wrote this library is no longer responding to\n    e-mail&#x2026;. it might be just easier to implement your desired\n    functionality yourself&#x2026;\n2.  Libraries can introduce considerable complexities, which may be\n    overkill in your situation&#x2026;.\n3.  While python itself is in the public domain, third party\n    libraries are often under more restrictive licenses. Not a big\n    deal for your private code, but if you work in a commercial\n    environment, it may be a real show stopper.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Using a library in your code\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Consider the following simple library [mylib.py](mylib.py).
