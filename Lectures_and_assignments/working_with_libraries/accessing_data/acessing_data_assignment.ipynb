However, some tasks have not yet been explained. Particularly,\nhow to create a dataframe from a list, or a dictionary. By now, you\nknow enough python to read online materials and search for solutions\nto a given problem on your own. So the point of this assignment is to\npractice working with the dataframe object, and to expand your agency\nto deal with problems which are not part of the course script.  I\nrecommend to refer to the following sources\n\n-   [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pandas-dataframe](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/python_pandas_dataframe.htm)\n-   [https://pandas.pydata.org/indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)\n-   [howto-read-csv-with-pandas](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-read-csv-file-using-pandas-ab1f5e7e7b58)\n-   [pandas csv export](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-export-pandas-dataframe-to-csv-2038e43d9c03)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### Submission instructions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["1.  Create a notebook ino your submissions folder with this name:\n    \"pandas-dataframe-FirstName-LastName\".

Please have the usual header with date,\n    name etc. (Do not forget to copy all datafile to your submission\n    folder as well).\n\n2.  All questions should be solved with pandas methods. You may have\n    to look up syntax or options either through the help system, or\n    by using the above links.\n\n3.  Marking Scheme (per question):\n    -   All variables declared and type hinting used throughout 1pt. No partial marks\n    -   Code produces correct output 2pts. 1pt if code is sort of\n        correct\n    -   Proper use of comments 1pt. There is no need for doc-strings\n        though\n    -   Code is self contained 1pt. Use first example code in the\n        \"Using pandas to read data from an excel file\" chapter, as a\n        template.\n    -   Max points per question: 5pts for a total of 14\\*5 = 70 pts\n\nFor each answer, please write self contained code, that is, it imports\nall libraries, declares all variables, imports all data etc., rather\nthen writing code which relies on data imported in a previous\ncell.

As above, but this time use the `loc` method to display the last\n    4 values in the third data column of the dataframe.\n\n5.  Use a pandas dataframe method to save your data frame as a Comma\n    Separated Textfile (CSV) into your local working directory. Your\n    Jupyter notebook can open CSV files, so please go and check if\n    the dataframe has been saved correctly.\n\n6.  Import the `cars.csv` into a dataframe, using the license plate\n    as index. Add a head statement to show the success of your code\n\n7.  As above, but this time use the `iloc` method to display the\n    second row of the dataframe.\n\n8.
