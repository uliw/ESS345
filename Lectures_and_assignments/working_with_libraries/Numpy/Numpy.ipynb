Furthermore, the numpy types typically carry a\nspecific meaning which enables us to use them to do linear algebra\n(cross product, scalar product, matrix inversion, etc., etc.).\n\nIn the following, we will use this library for it's ability to\nmanipulate lists of numbers.\n\nThe basic datatype in numpy, is the array.
