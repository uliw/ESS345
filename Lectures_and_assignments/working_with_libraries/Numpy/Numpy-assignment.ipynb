Add all the usual headers etc.\n\nIn the previous module, we used linear regression analysis to build a\nsimple linear model of the storks versus babies data (see\nFig. [storksandbabies](#storksandbabies))\n\n![img](storks.png \"The storks versus babies data\")\nThis figure, shows the data, the linear regression model, and a shaded\narea, which represents the 95% confidence interval. In the previous\nassignment, you added noise to linear data set, and explored how this\nnoise affects the accuracy of the regression analysis. You observed\nthat with increasing noise, the match between model and original data\nbecame worse. So the above confidence interval is the area where you\ncan be 95% sure that your regression model fits your data. I.e., in\nyour previous assignment, all orange lines would fit inside this\nenvelope. In other words, your regression analysis finds the best fit,\nbut depending how noisy your data is, there is uncertainty whether the\nbest fit is also the true fit. This uncertainty is expressed by the\nshaded confidence interval.\n\nNote that this is different from the uncertainty of a prediction you\nbase on your regression model. This so called prediction interval is\nmuch larger. But back to our original problem. We want to create some\ncode wich allows us to plot this confidence interval. There is no\nready made solution, but with a bit of numpy magic, we can create our\nown!\n\nThe shaded area in the above figure, is a polygon. If you were to draw\nthis by hand, you would first draw the outline, and then fill it with\ncolor. The following figure illustrates this approach:\n\n![img](polygon_n.png \"A polygon is drawn by following it's outline either clockwise or anticlockwise\")\n\nthe key here, is that we have to draw in a consistent direction,\neither clockwise, or anticlockwise (you remember those drawing by\nnumbers books?). We will look into the details of this below. But\nfirst we need to get the data from our regression model.\n\nAdd code in the below box which reads the water depths versus\nfractionation factor data you used before\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# read data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["next, create a linear regression analysis of this data which treats\nwater depth as the independent variable, and the fractionation factor\nalpha as the dependent variable.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# regression model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["now, we create the model predictions, first the simple linear\nprediction, and then we extract the confidence intervals we will use\nfor our polygon.

So this data\nis missing the x-coordinates, and it is not yet in a format which can\nbe used by the polygon function of matplotlib.\n\nAs we have seen above, in order to plot a polygon, we need a sequence\ncoordinate pairs (typically called vertices) for each polygon point,\nand this sequence must be ordered in such a way that it describes the\npolygon either in clockwise or counter-clock wise direction (see the\nabove figure).\n\nHere is what needs to be done:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# extract lower and upper boundary values"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# combine them into a new 1-d array in such way that they describe the\n# polygon in counter clockwise fashion"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Create a new vector of x-values which corresponds to the polygon\n# values in the previous cell"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# combine your new x and y values into a 2-dimensional array of\n# vertices.

A couple pointers though:\n\n1.  First create your regular regression graph (6 by 4 inches, dark\n    grid style, proper axis labels with units, no title, no legend,\n    but include the regression parameters similar to\n    Fig. [storksandbabies](#storksandbabies), and the regression line\n2.  The polygon method is not part of matplotlibs pyplot interface, so\n    you need to import it separately (see the below code snippet)\n3.  The polygon is made transparent withe alpha parameter (from 0 to\n    1). You still need to pay attention what is plotted first and last\n4.  Adding polygon to a plot does not update the plot axis limits. So\n    if there is no other data in the plot you need to set the axis\n    limits explicitly.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.patches import Polygon\n\n# create the polygon\npol :Polygon = Polygon(coords,alpha=0.2)\n\n# add the polyon to the plot\nax.add_patch(pol)\n\nprint(type(pol))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["For the second part of your assignment, create:\n\n-   a function which takes the output of `prediction.conf_int()` as\n    argument and returns a list vertices which can be used by the\n    polygon function function.\n-   The function should be fully annotated, have a doc-string, use type\n    hinting etc.\n-   Recast your so that it uses this function and place your code into\n    a single cell using the below template.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\"\"\"\nDescription:\nPurpose:\nAuthor:\nDate:\n\"\"\"\n# ----------- third party library imports ------------------\n\n# ----------- functions definitions  -----------------------\n\n# ----------- main program ---------------------------------\n# --- variable declarations\n\n# --- code starts here\n#"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Marking Scheme (23 pts)\n\n-   read data: 2pts\n-   regression model: 2pts\n-   predictions: 2pts\n-   upper and lower boundary values: 2pts\n-   Vector of increasing and decreasing x-values: 2pts\n-   2d-arrays with correct vertices: 2pts\n-   regular regression plot with regression line (1pt), regression parameters (1pt), correct layout and labels (1pt)\n-   Correctly plotted polygon (4pt)\n-   Correctly working function with docs string, type hints, etc. 4pts\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
