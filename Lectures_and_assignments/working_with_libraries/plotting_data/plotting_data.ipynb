Each of these libraries has their own way of\ndescribing graphical output, which can be very confusing. Furthermore,\nsome libraries provide an object oriented interface and procedural\ninterface. And to top it all, some libraries like pandas implement\ntheir own interface to some of the graphics libraries (and vice versa\n&#x2026;.). So if you start looking for help, you can find all sorts of\nmessy/conflicting advice\n\nFor this course we will matplotlib with the pyplot object oriented\ninterface. Matplotlib is widely used in the sciences, and the\ninterface is similar to Matlab. Furthermore, plotting is not really\nmagic, it is simply a series of commands. By the way, if you have\nworked with R before, you use the ggplot library which works similarly\nto graphing in R.\n\nFirst, we import our well known dataset, so we have some data to play\nwith. As a new twist, I will also use a library which can test whether\na file is present or not. This is because I spend 20 minutes debugging\nmy code without realizing that I had the wrong filename. So I decided\nto include this here. It may prove useful. The code is\nstraightforward, and simply raises an error if the file is not\npresent. In order to first test whether the file is present, we import\nthe os-library, which imports tools to deal with operating system\nrelated tasks, like checking whether a file is present. I recommend to\nuse this code snippet in your own\nsubmissions.  Towards\nthis end, I recommend to start building repository of useful code\nsnippets (i.e., reading an excel file, plotting XY data, etc..
