In order to submit your\n    assignment, you need to download it and submit it on Quercus\n    (ipynb and pdf format). Please have the usual header with date, name\n    etc.\n\n-   for some of the tasks, you need to lookup documentation on the\n    internet. Remember to use the object oriented matplotlib\n    interface\n\n-   Make sure that your pdf file is complete and shows all output\n    from your code cells\n\n-   Marking Scheme (per question):\n    -   All variables declared and type hinting used throughout 1pt.\n    -   Code produces correct output 2pt.\n    -   Code is self contained 1pt.\n    -   graphical output is correctly formatted (see the list below) 2pts\n    -   Total number of points: 8 \\* 5 = 40pts\n\nAll exercises:\n\n-   use self contained code\n-   use 6x4 inch plot size\n-   use the darkgrid scheme\n-   use the object oriented interface to matplotlib.pyplot\n\nUnless specified otherwise, all assignments should use the following\ndata. It is ok to generate these once at the beginning of your notebook\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\nimport math\n\n# generate a numpy array filled with values from\n# zero to 2*pi with a step size of 0.1\nx_1 :float = np.arange(0, math.pi*4, 0.1)\ny_1 :float = np.sin(x_1)         # calculate the sin(x)\ny_2 :float = np.cos(x_1)         # calculate the cos(x)\ny_3 :float = np.cos(x_1 * 2) + 2 # calculate the cos(x*2)+2\ny_4 :float = y_3 + + y_2 + y_1   # calcualte the sum y1 to y3"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Tasks:\n\n1.  Create a plot with x<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>1</sub> using matplotlib\n2.  Create a plot with x<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>1</sub> but this time you annotate the x and y axes with `X` and `Y`\n3.  As in 2, but this time add a legend which shows $y = \\sin(x)$ for\n    $x=0$ to $x=2*\\pi$. The legend should show the appropriate math\n    symbols.\n4.  As in 3, but this time add y<sub>4</sub> as second dataset. The legend for\n    y<sub>4</sub> should show the correct equation for y<sub>4</sub> (i.e., not y<sub>1</sub>+Y<sub>2</sub>+y<sub>3</sub>!).\n5.  As in 3, but this time add the second dataset to its own\n    plot. Arrange the plots in an array with one column and two rows,\n    with an image size of 5 by 8 inches. Rather then using a legend,\n    add a title to each subplot with the legend text (e.g., $y =\n         \\sin(x)$ for $x=0$ to $x=2*\\pi$). Also, add a title for the figure\n    (not the plot!). You can use the subtitle method of the figure\n    object.\n6.  As in #3, but now show that data as lineplot and overlay the\n    actual x/y pairs as a scatterplot\n7.  As in #7, but this time the color of the line should be different\n    from the scatter marker, and width of the line should be 4\n    pixels. Take care that the scatter markers are place on top of\n    the line.\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
