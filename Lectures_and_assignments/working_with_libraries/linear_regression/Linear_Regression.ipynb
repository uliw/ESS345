Storks were indeed a common sight in rural\nareas, and large enough to sell this story to a 3-year-old.\n\n![img](Linear_Regression/Ringed_white_stork_2019-11-22_15-14-15.png \"The Stork. Image by Soloneying, from ![img](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ringed_white_stork.jpg) Downloaded Nov 22<sup>nd</sup> 2019.\")\n\nTo bad, we are now grown up scientists with a penchant for critical\nthinking. Rather than believing this story, we want to see the data, and ask\nif this were true, we should see a good correlation between the number of storks\nand the number of babies. Low and behold, these two variables, actually\ncorrelate in a statistically significant way, i.e, the more storks we count in\na country, the higher the (human) birthrate. Since both variables increase\ntogether, this is called a positive correlation. See Fig. [4](#orgdbab230)\n\n![img](storks.png \"The birthrate and the number of stork pairs correlate in a statistical significant way. This analysis suggest that each stork pair delivers about 29 human babies, and that about 225 thousand babies were born otherwise. Data after [Mathews (2000)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zXX-6dp4X1heAb9XKq9ya3PrENI5beIH).\")\n\nNow, does this prove that the storks deliver the babies? Obviously (or so we\nthink) not. Just because two observable quantities correlate, does in no way\nimply that one is the cause of the other. The more likely explanation is that\nboth variables are affected by a common process (i.e., industrialization).\n\nIt is a common mistake to confuse correlation with causation. Another good\nexample is to correlate drinking with heart attacks. This surely will\ncorrelate but the story is more difficult. Are there e.g., patterns like\ndrinkers tend to do less exercise than non-drinkers? So even if you have a\ngood hypothesis why two variables are correlated, the correlation on its own,\nproves nothing.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Understanding the results of a linear regression analysis\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Regression analysis compares how well a dataset of two variables (lets\ncall them `x` and `y`) can be described by a function which allows us\nto predict the value of the dependent variable `y` based on the value\nof the independent variable `x`.  In the case of a linear regression,\nthis can be expressed by a linear equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:1}\ny = a+mx\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere `a` denotes the y-axis intercept, `m` denotes the slope. Note\nthat the above equation is a simple model, which we can use to make\npredictions about actual data. Linear regression analysis adjusts the\nparameters `a` and `m` in such a way that the difference between the\nmeasured data and the model prediction is minimized.\n\nFrom a user perspective, we are interested to understand how good the\nmodel actually is. and how to interpret the key indicators of a given\nregression model:\n\n-   **r^2:** or coefficient of determination. This value is in the range\n    from zero to one and expresses how much of the observed\n    variance in the data is explained by the regression\n    model. So a value of 0.7 indicates that 70% of the variance\n    is explained by the model, and that 30% of the variance is\n    explained by other processes which are not captured by the\n    linear model (e.g., measurements errors, or some non-linear\n    effect affecting `x` and `y`). In Fig. [BROKEN LINK: fig:storks] 38% of the\n    variance in the birthrate can be explained by the increase\n    in stork pairs.  Note that often you will also find the term\n    R^2. For a simple linear regression with two variables, r^2\n    equals R^2. However, if your model incorporates more than 2\n    variables, these numbers can be different.\n-   **p:** When you do a linear regression, you basically state the\n    hypothesis that `y` depends `x` and that they are linked by a\n    linear equation. If you test a hypothesis, you however also\n    have to test the so called **null-hypothesis**, which in this\n    case would state that `y` is unrelated to `x`. The p-value\n    expresses the likelihood that the null-hypothesis is true. So\n    a p-value of 0.1 indicates a 10% chance that your data does\n    not correlate. A p-value of 0.01, indicates a 1% chance that\n    your data is not correlated. Typically, we can reject the\n    null-hypothesis if `p < 0.05`, in other words, we are 95% sure\n    the null hypothesis is wrong. In Fig. [BROKEN LINK: fig:storks], we are 99.2%\n    sure the null hypothesis is wrong.
