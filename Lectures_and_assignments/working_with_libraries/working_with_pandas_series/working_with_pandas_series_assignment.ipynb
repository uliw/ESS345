B) To\nget more comfortable in translating equations to python code.

Use this dataframe for\nall questions below. For each answer, please write self contained\ncode, that is, it imports all libraries, declares all variables,\nimports all data, etc., rather then writing code which relies on data\nimported in a previous cell. Cut copy paste is your friend here. Note,\nyour function should be able to deal with arbitrary length series.\n\n1.  Using the above methods, find a way to set all values in A which\n    are smaller than say 4 to 0. Write the result into a new variable\n    `X`, rather then replacing the values in A. Note, do not use\n    builtin methods like replace for this operation, nor use a\n    loop (hint: use a boolean expression).\n\n2.  Write a short function and code snippet which calculates the\n    mean of a pandas series containing numbers. Do not use the builtin\n    functions or the pandas method for mean. Rather use your own code\n    to compute the $\\mu$ mean as\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\mu = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{i=N} X_i}{N}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    the capital sigma sign on the right side is the math symbol for a\n    sum, the subscript `i` refers to the index of a given vector\n    element, $X_i$ denotes an individual element (i.e. `X[i]`) and N is\n    equal to the number of elements in the series. In the equation\n    above I added the index expression to highlight the relation\n    between the equation and a pandas series, however, often you will\n    see the abbreviated form which means the same thing, but is faster\n    to write\n    \n     \\begin{equation}\n    \\mu = \\frac{\\sum X_i}{N}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    call your function and compare the result against the mean values\n    as returned by the pandas mean method, e.g.:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["print(f\"The mean value of A using my_mean = {my_mean(A)}\")\nprint(f\"The mean value of A using A.mean() = {A.mean()}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["3.  As before, but now we will compute the population standard\n    deviation sigma ($\\sigma$) which is defined as\n    \n    \\begin{equation}   \n     \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (X_i - \\mu)^2}{N-1}}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    where $\\mu$ is the mean value. Note, since your code regenerates\n    the dataframe from random numbers each time, you need to compute\n    $\\mu$ each time. Thus, this code also needs to define `my_mean()`\n    (you can obviously cut/copy/paste).  Again, your code should be\n    self contained, and compare your result against the builtin\n    pandas series method `A.std`.\n\nDo not use loops!\n\n4.  Write a program which imports the\n    isotope data from the last lecture as dataframe. Extract the delta\n    values as pandas series. Next, use the following two equations to\n    first split the delta values (`d34S` in the spreadsheet) into $^{32}S$\n    and $^{34}S$ and append the results to the dataframe as two new\n    columns (`S32` and `S34`). Next compute the delta values from $^{32}S$\n    and $^{34}S$,\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    ^{32}S = \\frac{1000}{(\\delta +1000) \\times R + 1000}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    ^{34}S = \\frac{(\\delta + 1000) \\times R}{(\\delta + 1000) \\times R + 1000}    \t\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\delta^{34}S = \\left(\n      \\frac{\n        \\left(\\frac{^{34}S}{^{32}S}\\right) _{Sample}}\n      {R}\n       -1\n      \\right) \\times 1000 \\quad [^0/_{00}]\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    and append the results to the dataframe as a new column called\n    `delta-new`. Compute the difference between the original and the\n    new delta (it should be very small or zero). Export the data\n    frame to a csv file.  Again, do not use loops, import whatever\n    you need, declare all variables, add docstrings to your function\n    definitions, use comments, and type hinting. Use an R-value of\n    `R=0.044162589`. Remember to break down any coding task into a\n    set of smaller steps which you can develop and test individually.\n    \n      Use the following template to organize your code. The example\n    and limitation lines are optional and mostly apply to functions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\"\"\" Description:\nPurpose\nExample: (provide an example how to call your code)?\nLimitations: (Are there cases your code does not handle)?\nAuthor:\nDate:\n\"\"\"\n# ----------- third party library imports ------------------\n\n# ----------- functions definitions  -----------------------\n\n# ----------- main program ---------------------------------\n# --- variable declarations\n\n# --- code starts here\n#"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
