In other words,\nthey have the same number of protons, but a different number of\nneutrons. You will likely have heard of oxygen or carbon isotopes,\nboth featuring prominently in the current climate change debate, and\nisotopes feature prominently in almost all geoscience research. \n\nStable isotopes are measured with a mass spectrometer where the oxygen\natoms are ionized, then accelerated, and the beam of accelerated ions\nis then send through a magnetic field, which will bend this beam. The\nions with additional neutrons, are heavier and thus will have a\ndifferent curve radius then the lighter ones (see\nFig. [fig:IRMS](#fig:IRMS)). Thus we can split the beam into two beams. The two\nbeams will then be collected by Faraday cups which count the number of\narriving ions (i.e., they register a voltage). Based on these\nvoltages, we can establish the ratio between these isotopes.\n\n![img](./Mass_Spectrometer_Schematic.png \"Schematic drawing of an isotope mass ratio monitoring mass spectrometer (IRMS).\")\n\nMost geological processes change the isotope ratio of a given element\nonly by a very small fraction.
