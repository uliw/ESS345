{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Functions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" In the previous module we used blocks of\nprogramming statements so that we can execute them repeatedly (loop\nstatements) or based on a given condition (if statements).\n\nFunctions are another way to group program statements. However, unlike\nifs and loops, functions allow us the create named code blocks. This\nallows us to write code which we can re-use in other programs.\n\nFunctions have the following characteristics:\n\n-   They allow us to group code sequences and refer to this group by\n    name. This is useful to declutter your code and is particularly\n    helpful if individual code sections have to be executed again and\n    again. Most of the python statements we have used so far, are\n    simply functions (e.g., the print statement).\n-   functions allow us to extend the capabilities of our program. We\n    could, for example, create a function called `bprint` which will\n    only print in bold.\n-   Functions allow us to isolate code sections from each other. What\n     happens inside the function, stays inside the function, and what\n     happens outside the function, stays outside the function.\n-   More to the point, functions provide a way to pass precisely\n    defined information to the function, and return precisely defined\n    result. So this greatly helps with program design, because we can\n    divide a program into functional parts, which we can test and\n    debug independently. In other words, we can reduce a complex\n    problem into series of less complex problems.\n-   the **value(s)** of a variable(s) can be passed into a function as\n    arguments to the function call (see below)\n-   The results of the computations inside the function can be\n    returned to the calling code with the return\n    statement.\n-   Functions must always be defined before you can use them. This is\n    best done at the beginning of the code\n\nThink of the following problem: You want to write an application which\nconverts a mineral name into it's chemical formula. We can divide this\nproblem into the following functional parts:\n\n1.  get user input\n2.  interpret the user input and find chemical formula (or create an\n    error message)\n3.  provide the result to the user\n\nIf we divide this problem with functions, we can write and test the\nfirst part even if we have no idea what to do about number 2 & 3. The\nsame goes for #2, you can develop and test this, even so you are\ncompletely ignorant about #1 (#3).\n\nNow, consider you are working in a team. Likely, you would distribute\nthe tasks along the functional blocks. But this scenario also\nhighlight an interesting problem, you need to agree what kind of data\nteam #1 will provide to team #2, and what #2 will provide to #3. So\nclearly, this requires a bit of planning, and more importantly good\ndocumentation.\n\nLet's do an actual example. We define a function with the `def`\nkeyword, followed by the function name and a pair of brackets() with\nthe usual colon symbol to denote the start of block\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def lookup_chemdata():\n    # add your code here\n    pass"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["the way this is written, this function would not know anything about\nthe data which exists outside the function.
