However, if you\n    declare a variable with the same name inside the function as well,\n    python will use the value inside the function, without changing\n    the value outside the function.\n    \n    This helps to isolate code sections\n    and prevents naming conflicts or accidental overwriting of a e.g.,\n    a counter.\n-   the **value(s)** of a variable(s) can be passed into a function as\n    arguments to the function call (see below)\n-   The result of a of the computations inside the function can be\n    returned to the calling code with the return statement.\n-   Functions must always be defined before you can use them.
