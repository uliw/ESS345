This useful to declutter your code and is particularly helpful if individual code sections have to be executed again and\n    again. Most of the python statements we have used so far,\n    are simply functions (e.g., the print statement).\n-   functions allow us to extend the capabilities of our program. We\n    could, for example, create a function called `bprint` which will\n    only print in bold.\n-   Code which is grouped inside of a function does have access to\n    variables that are defined outside of a function. However, if you\n    declare a variable with the same name inside the function as well,\n    python will use the value inside the function, without changing\n    the value outside the function. \n    \n    This helps to isolate code sections\n    and prevents naming conflicts or accidental overwriting of a, e.g.,\n    a counter.\n-   the **value(s)** of a variable(s) can be passed into a function as\n    arguments to the function call (see below)\n-   The results of the computations inside the function can be\n    returned to the calling code with the return statement.\n-   Functions must always be defined before you can use them.
