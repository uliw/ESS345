This was\nachieved by changing a number from its representation in the decimal\nsystem to the binary system.\n\nThere is no simple way to do the same for letters and\nsymbols. However, nothing prevents us from mapping letters to numbers,\nand then storing the number. The only extra step required, is to tell\nthe program that this number is meant to be a letter. Python will then\nuse a lookup table to figure out which letter to print as\noutput. Obviously, this will only work if everyone agrees to use the\nsame lookup-table&#x2026;\n\nWe can use the `chr()` function to show the character associated with\na given number\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"# Out [1]: \n# output\nA"}],"source":["print(chr(65))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["But how do we tell python that a given value should be interpreted as\na character? Using `chr()` each time we would like to see a character\nwould be pretty tedious.\n\nIn our last module, we discovered that each variable is assigned a\ntype (int, float etc.). These assignments are done when you assign a\nvalue to the variable. E.g., if you type `a=12` python will assign an\ninteger-type. If you type `a=12.1` python will assign an float-type.\n\nHowever, we can't simply write `a=b` to assign the letter `b` to the\nvariable a, because b could also be the name of a variable.
