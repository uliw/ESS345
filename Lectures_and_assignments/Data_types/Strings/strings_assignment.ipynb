Add the usual pre-amble (Title, Name,\nDate, student id etc.). (2 pts)\n\nUse the following strings for this exercise\n\n    s_1 = \"This is the first string\"\n    s_2 = \"This is the second string\"\n    s_3 = \"just some random letters\"\n\nIn order to solve the questions below you need to use your knowledge\nabout how to manipulate lists (i.e., ranges), and how to query the\nmethods provided by a string object. For each of the following\nQuestions, please add a text box (or comment), which states the question\nnumber (and preferably the question as well). Again, do not type your results,\ninstead write code, which yields the requires results.\n\n1.  Provide some code which adds a comma to the end of `s_1` (2pts)\n2.  Using your knowledge about ranges, rewrite `s_1` in such a way\n    that the comma is being removed (i.e., `s_1 = s_1....` )  (1pts)\n3.  Provide a code example which combines these 3 strings into `s_4`  (1pts)\n4.  In a new cell, rewrite this example in a such away that the\n    resulting `s_4` has proper commas and blanks after each substring,\n    e.g., \"This is the first string, This is the second string&#x2026;..\"\n    (typing it does not count).  (2pts)\n5.  Use a string-object method which will split your string into 3\n    lines. Your results should look like this.\n    \n        ['This is the first string',\n         'This is the second string',\n         'just some random letters']\n    \n    pay attention to the location of the commas, and the justification\n    on the left. This may require some thinking.  (2 pts)\n6.  Explain whether your method changes data in place and why it \n    requires/does not require a print statement to show the result. (2 pts)\n7.  Provide a statement which fixes the capitalization in `s_4`. Note,\n    your statement should replace the capitalization in `s_4`. Add\n    `print(s_4)` to show the result of your operation.  (1pts)\n8.  Provide a one-line statement which removes all blanks from\n    `s_4`. Add `print(s_4)` to show the result of your operation.  (1pts)\n9.  Provide a one-line statement using a string method which adds\n    blanks after each comma in `s_4`. Add `print(s_4)` to show the\n    result of your operation.  (1pts)\n10. Upload your assignment on Quercus as usual\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
