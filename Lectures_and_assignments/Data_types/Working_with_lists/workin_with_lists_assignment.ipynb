Also, which of the methods\nassociated with `a` can tell you how many bits are used to store the\nvalue of a? To answer your question, create a code block and type the\nrelevant commands.

You get 2 pts\neach for the first 2 solutions, and 4pts if you can think of a third. All 3\napproaches must have been discussed in class before, so esoteric solutions\nfound on the internet, do not count.
