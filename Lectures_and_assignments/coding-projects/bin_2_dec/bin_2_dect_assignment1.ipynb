Going forward, each of your programs (as\nopposed to snippets) should start with a doc-string, which contains a\nshort text about what the program does, and how to use it, and who authored\nit.

That is,\nthe type of variable (int, float, string), is determined at the time\nyou assign it a value. This makes for fast coding, but when reading\ncode written by other people, it is thus often difficult to understand\nwhat the code is doing. Python provides so called type hints, to help\nwith this situation. Typically, this is overkill for a short script,\nbut the minute you start working on larger projects or in a team, it\ngreatly helps clarity.

Look up the module on\nproblem-solving. Step number one is to have a plan:\n\n-   re-read the above and see whether the problem can be divided into\n    smaller problems\n\n-   evaluate whether any of those problems have been encountered before. If\n    so, look up what you have learned before (at the very least, you have\n    seen how to ask for user input, and we did a module on decimal to binary\n    conversion\n\n-   Create a new notebook (see below) and start by writing down your notes for\n    steps #1, #2, #3, then start your first code section with #4.\n\nNow that you have a plan, continue to step #2 and #3: Can you restate\nthe task in such a way that the job can be broken up into two\nindividual tasks, which can be developed and tested individually? Are\nsome of the tasks suitable to be packaged into a function? Consider\nand explain your choices. Before doing so, revisit the module on\nfunctions and consider their characteristics.\n\nStep #4 Start with what you know. I.e., write the easy part of the\nprogram, and test it. E.g., your program may not yet do the binary to\ndecimal conversion, but it may ask for user input and print it back to\nthe screen.\n\nApply #5 and #6 to the part of the problem where you do not see an\nimmediate solution.\n\nApply #7 and #8 in working towards a working solution. Also, ask, and\nexplain to others what is not working (this forces you to restate the\nproblem, and often leads to progress).\n\nOnce you have a working code, test that it works. Particularly boundary cases like:\n\n-   \"0\"\n-   \"1\"\n-   \"00\"\n-   \"01\"\n-   \"10\"\n-   \"11\"\n\nnext, write down what your program will not do, e.g., what will happen if you enter:\n\n-   \"-011\"\n-   \"123\"\n-   \"xwz\"\n\nMore power to you if your program knows what to do with this, but for\nthis exercise, it is sufficient if you document that these cases are\nnot handled.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Submission instructions and marking scheme\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["You must copy this notebook to your submissions folder before editing\nit.
