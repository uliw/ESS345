Unlike regular comments, doc-strings will be used by\nthe `help()` command , and they can span multiple lines. Going forward,\neach of your programs (as opposed to snippets) should start with a\ndoc-string, which contains a short text about what the program does,\nand how to use it, and who authored it.

That is,\nthe type of variable (int, float, string), is determined at the time\nyou assign it a value. This makes for fast coding, but when reading\ncode written by other people, it is thus often difficult to understand\nwhat the code is doing. Python provides so called type hints, to help\nwith this situation. Typically, this is overkill for a short script,\nbut the minute you start working on larger projects or in a team, it\ngreatly helps clarity.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = 12\nl = [1, 4, 6]\nt = (4, 9, 1)\ns = \"\"\n# This should be written as\na :int   = 12\nl :list  = [1, 4, 6]\nt :tuple = (4, 9, 1)\ns :str   = \"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Note, that python ignores the type hints, so this will not prevent you\nfrom doing something like this:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a :int   = 12\na = \"ssdsd\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["but your code will become more readable.

Look up the module on\nproblem-solving, and then follow the steps:\n\n1.  Create a plan (best is to start with a notebook section called \"Plan\", and then make list for each point):\n2.  Restate the problem\n3.  Divide the problem. Write down each substep, even if you don't\n    know yet how to implement a given step.\n\n4.  Start with what you know (and look for analogies). Have any of\n    these steps been encountered before? If so, look up what you have\n    learned before (at the very least, you have seen how to ask for\n    user input, and we did a module on decimal to binary conversion).\n\n5.  Reduce the problem, in this case, write code for each sub step, and test the code individually,\n\n6.  If each of those work as expected, start combining them (use the\n    submission template).\n\n7.  Last but not least, don't get frustrated. These exercise are\n    meant for you to struggle, but if after 10 minutes you are still\n    lost, post your problem in the discussion board on Quercus, and\n    if all else fails, talk to the instructor or TA. Asking and\n    explaining to others what is not working forces you to restate\n    the problem, and often leads to progress.\n\nOnce you have a working code, test that it works. Particularly boundary cases like:\n\n-   \"0\"\n-   \"1\"\n-   \"00\"\n-   \"01\"\n-   \"10\"\n-   \"11\"\n\nnext, add a section to your program doc-string which explains what\nyour program will not do, e.g., what will happen if you enter:\n\n-   \"-011\"\n-   \"123\"\n-   \"xwz\"\n\nMore power to you if your program knows what to do with this, but for\nthis exercise, it is sufficient if you document that these cases are\nnot handled.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Submission instructions and marking scheme\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Please use the below template for your submission.
