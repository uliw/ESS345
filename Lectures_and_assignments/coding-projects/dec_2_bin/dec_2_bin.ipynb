After that your code should end with a good by message.  Once you\nhave the user input, use a home made function which tests whether the\ninput is positive, and of type integer. For the latter, use the built\nin function =isinstance(). Your function should return a truth value\nwhich can be used in the calling code. If the input, is indeed of type\ninteger and positive, call a homegrown function which converts from\ninteger to binary. For any other input, print an error message and\nrequest new input.  In other words, you will need the following\ningredients:\n\n-   A while loop which handles the user input\n-   A function which tests for positive integer\n-   A function which converts from integer to binary, and return the\n    binary value back to the calling code (i.e., the printing should be\n    handled in the calling code).\n\nRemember to test each of these components individually, before\nassembling the whole program!\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### New concepts/functions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   `isinstance()`\n-   `range()`\n-   `break` and `continue` in loop statements\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### A note on the integer to binary conversion\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This function should not use the builtin integer to binary\nconversion.
