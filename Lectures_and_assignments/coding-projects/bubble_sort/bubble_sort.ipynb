{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Sorting a list\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["There are many ways to sort a list of numbers. Some are fast, some\nrequire plenty of memory, and most are pretty complex in order to be\nfast without consuming to much memory. Here, we will use a slow, but\nsimple algorithm, the so called bubble sort. Consider the following\nlist of objects (imagine them as little towers with different heights,\nwhere the number of stacked X's represents the height of the\ntowers). The characters a the bottom are the respective names of the\ntowers.\n\n             X\n             X X   X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A B C D E F\n\nIn order to sort this list by height, we first compare the first and\nsecond element (`A` & `B`). Since `A` is smaller than `B`, no action\nis required. Next we compare the second and third element (`B` and\n`C`). Since `B` is taller than `C`, it is clearly out of order. We can\nrectify this by switching the order of `B` & `C` to `C` and `B`\n\n               X\n             X X   X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C B D E F\n\nNext we continue with the third and fourth element. Clearly, `B` is\ntaller than `D`. So we swap positions again and get\n\n                 X\n             X   X X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C D B E F\n\nNow for the fourth and fifth element. Again, `B` is taller than\n`E`. So we swap both\n\n                   X\n             X   X X\n           X X X X X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C D E B F\n\nand finally for the last two elements. Again, `B` is taller than\n`F`. So we need to do another swap, and get\n\n                     X\n             X   X   X\n           X X X X   X\n           X X X X X X\n    Name:  A C D E F B\n    Index: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nAs you can see, this list is not fully sorted yet. All we achieved is\nthat the tallest tower has been moved to the end. This is however an\nimprovement over the original list. If we repeat this process, we will\nmove the second tallest tower to the right until it will be in front\nof B. We can repeat this process until the list is fully sorted.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### How do I solve this?\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In order to transform the above into computer code, lets first\nconsider what kind of decisions/actions have to be made in order to\nsort the list:\n\n1.

Likely,\nyou will need a list of numbers, a loop which works through the list,\ndo some comparisons etc.. So what are the program elements you need?\n\n1.  The list `l` which is provided by the instructor\n2.  A for loop and a counter `i` so that you van access each list\n    element and the element to the right of this element (i.e., `l[i]`\n    and `l[i+1]`).\n3.  An if statement which decides whether `l[i] > l[i+1]` or not.\n4.  A swap statement (see below)\n5.  From the above, it is also clear, that you may have to repeat the\n    bubble sort until the list is fully sorted. These kind of open\n    ended operations are well suited to while loops, which ends when\n    the list is sorted.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### How do I structure my code?\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["You may recall, that is usually a good idea to avoid\ncomplexity. Rather you want to design your code in small chunks which\nyou can test individually.  This can be either done by starting with\nthe overall code structure, and then breaking it down into chunks, e.g.\n\n    While loop which executes until all elements are sorted\n          for loop which does a single pass bubble sort\n              is swap needed\n                 swaw\n    \t     \n          decide if we need another pass, \n          or whether we can end the while loop\n\nor by starting with the code fragments you will need, i.e.,\n\n    write code which does the swap\n    test this\n    \n    write code which does a single pass bubble sort\n    test this\n    \n    embed this code into a while loop\n    test this\n\nWhich approach you choose, depends on the programming problem. If you\nrecall the binary to decimal conversion, we used a top down approach,\nwhere we first established a prototype which handled the user input,\nand in a second step added the code which does the conversion.\n\nHowever, in the above example, the termination of the while loop\ndepends on the result of the for loop which does the bubble sort,\nwhich itself depends on the ability to swap numbers.  So to me, it\nseems easier to start with the swapping, followed by the bubble-sort,\nfollowed by the while loop.\n\nNext, we need to decide whether we write the code bits as functions,\nor whether we all mangle it together. This is a personal choice, and\nit will vary with experience. However your code will be easier to read\nand easier to test, if you break it down into functions. So you will\nneed to create the following functions:\n\n-   `swap_list_elements`\n-   `single_pass_bubble_sort`\n-   `bubble_sort`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["##### Swapping numbers\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Here I will provide the code to swap numbers, since it is not obvious\nthat this is way to go\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a :int = 12\nb :int = 4\nprint(a,b)\nb, a = a, b # swap the values of a and b\nprint(a,b)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["lets encapsulate this into a function.
