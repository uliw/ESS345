* ESS345 Computational Geology: File System Exercise



Cellphones and modern operating systems more or less hide the actual

structure where and how your files are stored.  While this course aims
to stay away from operating system dependent content, you will need to
be able to download a file, find it, and upload it again.

The major elements of a file system are 
  1) The file system root. This is where it all begins.@@latex:\index{file system!root}@@
  2) File system folders (or directories). Directories typically
     contain other directories or files. However, they can be empty as
     well @@latex:\index{file system!folder} \index{file system!directory}@@
  3) Individual files. There are different file types, some are files
     which you can execute (aka programs), others are word files or

     @@latex:\index{file system!executable file}@@ images. On most
     operating systems, the file type is indicated by the so called
     "extension". E.g., on a windows computer, the firefox executable
     file is usually called =firexfox.exe=, where =.exe= indicates
     that this is file is program. On a Mac, the extension =.dmg= is
     used. Word files usually carry the extension =.docx=, and images
     are usually differentiated by the image type (e.g., =.jpg=,
     =.gif=, =.png=, =.tiff=, etc., etc.)

File systems are typically hierarchical. The file system root contains
folders which itself contain folders or files. This allows us to
organize our files systematically. On my computer, the file
system hierarchy looks like the one you see in Fig.[[fig:one]]. On your
computer, the names and the locations will be different, but you will
find that your file system follows a similar tree Structure:
