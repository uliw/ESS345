If you open your file browser (or file explorer or "finder" on Mac),
it will only show you the files and folders in your home directory
(the one which is called =/uliw= in the above picture) but not the
full picture. *The names and the structure you see will be different
on your computer*

To expose the full path, you need to do the following:

1. On a Windows computer: Open Explorer and go to =My Computer= ->
   =Drive C:= (it could also be =This PC -> Windows8_OS (C:)=). You
   may also need to activate the option "Show hidden files"
2. On a Mac: Expose the hard disk you are working with by 
   [[https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-turn-on-drive-icon-mac-macbook/][following
   these instructions:]]

Now you have the tools to create your file system map. Please create
an image similar to the above. Note that the above image is from my
linux computer. This will look very different on a Mac, or a
PC. However, you will find the following elements irrespective of your
operating system:

1. The full path to the directory where your operating system stores
   the executable for your browser (e.g., =firefox.exe= on windows or
   =firefox.dmg= (or firefox.app) on a mac (or whatever your browser
   is called). Please include the name of the executable and it's file
   extension as well (use an oval to denote files, and square boxes
   for folders (see the example image). Note that in the above image,
   the octave program is has no extension (that is a unix thing).
 
2. The full path to the directory where your browser stores your
   downloads. In my case, this would be =/home/uliw/Downloads/= (*test
   this by downloading a file!*)
3. Note, if you don't have software to do a block diagram, you can
   draw the figure by hand, and take a picture with your cellphone.
4. Save your figure in *jpg format* using the following naming
   convention:

    =Firstname-Lastname-FS-exercise.jpg=.

   Note the absence of any blanks, the use of the dash in the file
   name, and the way the capitalization is used. We will use this type
   of file name throughout the course.  Note that some programs will
   save your image file as =filename.jpeg=. Quercus will complain
   about the =jpeg= extension. Simply rename it to =filename.jpg=, and
   all is well.

** Last but not least

   - review the above learning outcomes
   - if you do not feel confident about any of these, please review
     the corresponding textbook chapter.
   - If this does not help, please post on the discussion board.

** Marking Scheme
 - 4pts for the correct file system tree
 - 2pts for using the correct image format
 - 3pts for using the correct filename template.
