On a Windows computer: Open Explorer and go to `My Computer` ->\n    `Drive C:` (it could also be `This PC -> Windows8_OS (C:)`). You\n    may also need to activate the option \"Show hidden files\"\n2.  On a Mac: Expose the hard disk you are working with by \n    [following\n    these instructions:](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-turn-on-drive-icon-mac-macbook/)\n\nNow you have the tools to create your file system map. Please\ncreate an image similar to the above, which shows the following\nelements:\n\n1.  The full path to the directory where your operating system stores\n    the executable for your browser (e.g., `firefox.exe` on windows or\n    `firefox.dmg` on a mac (or whatever your browser is called). Please\n    include the name of the executable as well (use an oval to denote\n    files, as opposed to the square boxes, use for the folders (see the\n    example image).\n\n2.  The full path to the directory where your browser stores your\n    downloads. In my case, this would be `/home/uliw/Downloads/` (**test\n    this by downloading a file!**)\n3.  Note, if you don't have software to do a block diagram, you can\n    draw the figure by hand, and take a picture with your cellphone.\n4.  Save your figure in **jpg format** using the following naming\n    convention:\n    \n    `Firstname-Lastname-FS-exercise.jpg`.\n    \n    Note the absence of any blanks, the use of the dash in the file\n    name, and the way the capitalization is used. We will use this type\n    of file name throughout the course.\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
