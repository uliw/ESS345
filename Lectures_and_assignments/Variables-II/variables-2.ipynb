However,\nthere are some time tested best practices:\n\n1.  Variable names must start with a letter\n2.  Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores\n    (i.e., no blank spaces or special symbols)\n3.  Avoid variable names which are too general or too wordy. E.g.,\n    rather than `my_first_variable` call it `length` or any other\n    descriptive term.\n4.  Avoid letters like \"I\" or \"O\" where it is hard to know whether you\n    mean lowercase \"I\", upper case \"I\", or the number \"1\", similarly,\n    \"O\" is easily confused with zero\n5.  Variables names should always be lower case\n6.  Compound names should always be connected by an underscore. i.e.,\n    `student_id` rather than `student-id` which could be interpreted as\n    `student` minus `id`\n7.  And it is always a good idea to add some comments which explain\n    what your variable means (more on this later)\n8.  If in doubt, google \"Python Naming Conventions\"\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Assignment\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Create a new notebook with the headline \"ESS345 Computational Geology:\nVariables - II\" You did create template last time, so this should be\nstraight forward, including the notebook name and location.

Let's take a closer look to understand what happened here:\n\nWhen you hit `shift+enter` you send the commands you have typed into\nthe code cell to the python interpreter. This is just another computer\nprogram which will read your commands and try to make sense of\nit. Before running your code, the interpreter will do some sanity\nchecks, and in the above case, it finds that the variable \"A\" was\nnever defined. It thus prints:\n\n1.  a red line\n2.  the type of error, in this case \"NameError\", and some information\n    about the sequence how the errors are listed.\n3.  the type of input (ipython) and in which cell it occurred, followed\n    by the memory address and the module name (let's ignore this for\n    the moment)\n4.  the last couple of lines before the error occurred\n5.  the line where the error occurred\n6.  and if you are lucky some information why the error occurred.\n\nIn your assignment, add a text cell below the code cell with the error,\nwith the following content\n\n    ErrorName  = \n    Input_Type =\n    Cell_number where error occurred = \n    Memory address where error occurred =\n    Module name where error occurred = \n    Line Number where error occurred = \n    Explanation of error type = \n\nand add the data you get from the actual error message after the equal\nsigns.  If you have difficulties seeing the various elements above,\nplease talk to the TA or instructor\n\nOK, let's add another code cell and execute the following statement\n\n    a-b = 5\n\nyour mileage may vary (YMMV) but you may either get no result at all,\nor an error message. If you get no result, go to your menu bar and\nselect `Kernel -> Restart` and execute your cell again.\n\nExplain in a text cell why you get an error. Then add a new code cell\nand execute this statement\n\n    a b = 5\n\nand explain why it fails.\n\nLast but not least, execute this statement\n\n    f_g = 5\n\nExplain why this statement succeeds, and what are the values for f &\ng?\n\nLast but not least, add a final text cell, and write down what you\nlearned in this module.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Marking scheme:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["1.  2 point if the filename follows the file-name Template (capitalization, spaces, and dashes!)\n2.  2 points if the content is as requested.\n3.  2 points for each text cell with the correct explanation (8 pts\n    total)\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
