The results of comparisons are reported as the logical (boolean)\n    values of either `True`, or `False`. Internally they are\n    represented by a single bit wich is either 1 or 0. Use a comparison\n    operator to investigate how `True` or `False` relate to the\n    numerical values of 0 and 1 (4pts)\n\n2.  Does capitalization of the word `true` matter or not? What happens\n    if you change the capitalization off this keyword? How does your\n    notebook indicate that `True` has a special meaning? (4 pts)\n3.  Being mindful of the fact that integer numbers are different than\n    floating point numbers, predict the outcome of the following\n    comparison (2 pts)\n    \n        a = 12\n        b = 12.0\n        a == b\n4.  Edit the following lines and add the boolean value (i.e.,\n    True/False) for each statement after the hash symbol. Note, do not\n    enter code code here, your answer should be a textcell. You are\n    welcome to use code in order to test your answers, but it should\n    not be part of your answer (10 pts).\n    \n        5 == 4        # \n        2 != 3        # \n        5 > 4         # \n        5 < 4         # \n        1 >= 1        # \n        2 <= 2        # \n        -12 < -4      #\n        True == True  #\n        True != False #\n        True != true  #\n        True > False  #\n\n5.  Edit the following lines and add the boolean value (i.e.,\n    True/False) for each statement after the hash symbol. Note, do not\n    enter code here, your answer should be a text cell. You are welcome\n    to use code to test your answers, but I strongly recommend to first\n    this on paper. Again, the answer requires no code.
