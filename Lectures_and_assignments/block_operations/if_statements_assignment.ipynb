Please use this method from now on.\n\n**Date:**\n\n**First Name:**\n\n**Last Name:**\n\n**Student: Id**\n\n1.  Write a short code snippet which uses the variable a (`a = 3)`.\n    If a equals 3, your code should print `a equals three`. If a is\n    larger than 3 your code should print `a is larger than three`,\n    and if a is smaller than 3, your code should print\n    `a is smaller than 3`.\n    Use three independent if statements to achieve this\n    result. Test and verify your code with different values for\n    `a`. Correct if statements 1pt, correct comparison statements\n    1pt, correct print statements 1pt, 3 tests 1pt\n\n2.  Same as above, but this time use a single if statement with\n    `elif` and `else`.  Test and verify your code with different\n    values for `a`. Correct elif & else statements: 2pts, correct\n    comparison: 1pt\n\nr\n\n1.  Now modify your code in such a way that the comparison is no\n    longer hard-coded, i.e., use a second variable `b` so that your\n    comparison is done like `a ==` b. Your print statement should\n    reflect the dynamic nature of `b` i.e., it should now print the\n    value of a and b and their respective relation:\n     `3 equals 3`.\n     Test and verify your code with different values for `a` and\n    `b`. Correct if statements & comparison: 2pts, correct print\n    statements: 1pt\n\n2.  If you were to execute this code block, what would be the result\n    (2pts):\n    \n        a = 5\n        \n        if (a == 5) :\n           print(f\"a equals five\")\n        if a > 3 :\n           print(f\"a is larger than three\")\n        if a < 5 :\n           print(f\"a is smaller than five\")\n        if a < 10:\n          print(f\"a is smaller than 10\")\n\n5.  How would you need to modify the **logic** of the above code so\n    that it only prints the result of the first true comparison (but\n    not the fact that a is smaller than 10)? Write your code below and\n    test it with values of `a=3` and `a=9`.  Note, you must keep all\n    comparisons in the code! (2 pts)\n6.  Write if-statement(s) which depending on the value of `a` results\n    in one of the two statements. Test your code with various values\n    of a (and make sure to include the numbers 3 and 7 in your\n    test). Correct statements 2pts, tests 1pt.\n    \n        a is inside the range from 3 to 7\n        a is outside the range from 3 to 7\n    \n    Note: when I say range from 3 to 7, then 3 and 7 are part of this range.\n7.  Do the same as in the above, but this time use a combination of boolean\n    and comparison operators to create a single if statement which will\n    create the above output (i.e., you only have one if-block, and one\n    else-block). (2 pts)\n8.  Without using boolean operators, write some code which tests\n    whether the value of `a` is in the range between 100 and above 80,\n    in the range between 80 but above 60, in the range between 60 but\n    above 40.  Your code should print a warning message if `a` is\n    larger than 100 and smaller than 40. Otherwise, your code should\n    print which bucket `a` belongs to (where a bucket is one of the\n    intervals, i.e., 80 to 60, etc.). Test your code for various\n    values of `a`. Make sure you test the boundary cases 80, 60, 40,\n    the extreme cases like 110 and 20, and intermediate values like\n    85, 64 and 55. (8pts)\n9.  As in the above, but this time use boolean operators (8pts)\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
