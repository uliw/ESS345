Write a short code snippet which uses the variable a (`a :int =3)`.\n     If a equals 3, your code should print `a equals three`. If a is\n    larger than 3 your code should print `a is larger than three`, and if\n    a is smaller than 3, your code should print `a is smaller than 3`. Use\n    three independent if statements to achieve this result. Test and\n    verify your code with different values for `a`.\n\n2.  Same as above, but this time use a single if statement with `elif` and\n    `else`.  Test and verify your code with different values for `a`.\n\n3.  Now modify your code in such a way that the comparison is no longer\n    hard-coded, i.e., use a second variable `b :int 3` so that your\n    comparison is done like `a =` b=. Your print statement should reflect\n    the dynamic nature of `b` i.e., it should now print the value of a and\n    b and their respective relation: `3 equals 3`. Test and verify your\n    code with different values for `a` and `b`\n\n4.  If you were to execute this code block, what would be the result:\n    \n        a :int = 5\n        \n        if a == 5 :\n            print(f\"a equals five\")\n        if a > 3 :\n           print(f\"a is larger than three\")\n        if a < 5 :\n           print(f\"a is smaller than five\")\n        if a < 10:\n          print(f\"a is smaller than 10\")\n\n5.  How would you need to modify the logic of the above code so that it only\n    prints the result of the first true comparison? Write your code below\n    and test it with values of `a=3` and `a=9`.  Note, you must keep all comparisons in the code!\n6.  Write if-statement(s) which depending on the value of `a` results in\n    one of the two statements. Test your code with various values of a (and\n    make sure to include the numbers 3 and 7 in your test).\n    \n        a is inside the range from 3 to 7\n        a is outside the range from 3 and 7\n7.  Do the same as in the above, but this time use a combination of boolean\n    and comparison operators to create a single if statement which will\n    create the above output (i.e., you only have one if-block, and one\n    else-block).\n8.  Without using boolean operators, write some code which tests whether\n    the value of `a` is in the range between 100 and 80, 80 and 60, 60\n    and 40. Your code should print a warning message if `a` is larger than\n    100 and smaller than 40. Otherwise, your code should print which bucket\n    `a` belongs to (where a bucket is one of the intervals, i.e., 80 to 60,\n    etc.). Test your code for various values of `a`.\n9.  As in the above, but this time use boolean operators\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
