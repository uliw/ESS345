At this point, we will set the switch s to `False` and\nthe loop will stop. Infinite loops are a bit tricky. If you get your\nlogic wrong, they will run forever (i.e., say your counter was inside\nthe if statement, and as such, n would always be zero, so the if-clause would always be 1 == 3, which is False &#x2026;. happened to me!) If\nthat happens to you go to the kernel menu, and restart your notebook\nkernel.\n\n17. Now for a more complex problem, write a short piece of code\n    which finds the largest power of two, which still fits into, e.g. 10234. You can probably do this analytically, but for the sake of this exercise, let's use a while-loop. Your code should output a\n    single line, which states \"that the largest power of 2 which still\n    fist into 10234 is &#x2026;.) test your code for various\n    values. Specifically include values of 0, 1, 2, 64, and 10234.\n18. As in the above, but this time we automate the tests, by creating a\n    list first, and then use a for loop to work through the list items, e.g.:\n    \n        a = [0, 1, 2, 64, 1023]\n        for e in a:\n           # add your while loop here\n\nSo while statements are super useful if you wait for something to\nhappen.
