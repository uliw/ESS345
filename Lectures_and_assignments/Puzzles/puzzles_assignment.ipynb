For each puzzle, create one text cell\nwhich states the puzzle number followed by a single code cell which\nproduces the desired output.  To submit your assignment, you need\nto download it and submit it on Quercus (please use pdf and notebook\nformat). Your pdf version should show the output of your code cells.\n\nSo, without further ado, lets put the above principles to work. For\nthe purpose of training our problem solving skills, we will reduce the\nnumber of coding techniques, and only allow loops, counters,\nconditionals and print statements.  All the below exercises require\nyou to create some python code which will match the output pattern\nshown in the particular question. The goal is to create these patterns\nwith one or more loop statements (including loops which use the\nrange function - if in doubt, go back to the previous chapters - note,\nyour lecture script has an index).
