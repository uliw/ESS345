Your pdf version should show the output of your code cells.\n\nSo, without further ado, lets put the above principles to work.

So far, we have used\nfor-loops to iterate over a given list. However, what about the case where\nyou want to run a loop, e.g., five times? You could create a list with 5\nelements yourself, but that is tedious and not very flexible. It is better\nto use the range function which will create a disposable and anonymous\nlist. Say you want to run your loop five times, you can simply write:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["for e in range(5):\n    print(e)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["notice that we never declare or initialize any variable here, we just\nuse the output of `range()` (I leave it up to you to explore the full\nsyntax of this command).\n\n1.  Write a program which uses a loop and only two print statements to\n    create the output below. If you can't see the immediate solution go to\n    problem #2, which is the same question but stated more simply.\n    \n        XXXXX\n        XXXX\n        XXX\n        XX\n        X\n2.  Write a program which uses only two print statements to create the\n    output below. If you can't see the immediate solution go to\n    problem #3 which is the same question but in even further reduced form:\n    \n        XXXXX\n        XXXXX\n        XXXXX\n        XXXXX\n        XXXXX\n3.  Write a program which uses only one print statement to create this\n    output:\n    \n        XXXXX\n4.  Write a program which uses only two print statements and only two\n    loops to create the output below. Initially, this may look\n    puzzling. But you probably recognize that you solved an analogous\n    problem in #1. So the only problem left to solve is to find a way\n    to count inside a loop first upwards to a certain number and then\n    from thereon backward.\n    \n        X\n        XX\n        XXX\n        XXXX\n        XXX\n        XX\n        X\n5.  Write a program which uses no more than the three print statements\n    mentioned above (i.e., \"X\", ,\" \", and the linefeed to create the\n    following pattern\n    \n        XXXXX\n         XXX\n          X\n6.  Similar to 5, write a program which creates the following pattern\n    \n          X\n         XXX\n        XXXXX\n         XXX\n          X\n\n7.  Similar to 6, write a program which creates the following\n    pattern. Again, your code can not contain more than five print\n    statements. Think of it as a puzzle involving loops and counters. While\n    it looks complicated at first, try and decompose it into pieces you\n    have solved before (in fact, most of the code for this piece has been\n    used before). Once you have some ideas, create a game plan, and solve\n    it step by step (say start with the left side of the figure&#x2026;).\n    \n        X            X \n         XX        XX\n          XXX    XXX\n           XXXXXXXX\n           XXXXXXXX\n          XXX    XXX\n         XX        XX\n        X            X\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Marking Scheme\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   Proper file name for your submission files 2pts\n-   All needed headers in your submission files 2pts\n-   2 pts for each solution which follows the rules, and produces the\n    requested output. 1pt for each solution, which is at least 50% correct.\n-   Total points = 16 pts.\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
