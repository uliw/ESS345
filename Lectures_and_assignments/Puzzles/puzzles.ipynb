Unlike most programming books, it focuses on problem\nsolving, rather than computing. Unfortunately all its exercises are in\n`C++`, but the introductory and conclusions chapters are highly\nrecommended reading.\n\nThe basic premise of the book is that most students do not struggle\nwith a computing language per se, but rather with the process of using\na program to solve a problem. The following chapter is a heavily\ncondensed version of Chapter 1 in Spraul's book.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### General Problem Solving Principles\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Problem solving skills vary tremendously between people, and it is not\nsomething you can learn like any other method, because it is an\ninherently creative process, not a methodical one. However, you will\nget better with practice, and there a few guidelines which can help\nwith the process. The following list will prove helpful whenever you\nstruggle with an problem where there is no obvious solution:\n\n1.  **Always have a plan:** Even if you don't know what is going on, you\n    can always have a plan. Think of mapping, you may not have a\n    faintest clue of what you are dealing with, but you know that by\n    methodical mapping (taking stations, measure strike and dip, map\n    perpendicular to strike), you will zero in on the solution. The\n    same is true for computing.  Here, you probably start out with\n    writing down some general pseudo code. You will likely have to\n    refine your code, as you go, but this is still infinitely more\n    useful than just random exploration.\n2.  **Restate the Problem:** A good way to achieve this, is to restate\n    the problem in your own words, and then explain to one of your\n    peers, or your instructor for comments. This is often the first\n    and most important step in formulating a plan. Remember to\n    describe the goal, not the way.\n3.  **Divide the Problem:** Most complex problems can be understood as a\n    series of smaller problems. In coding terms, we would think of\n    loops, conditionals, and functions. This is the part where you\n    start writing high level pseudo code. E.g., 1) A while loop which\n    get's user input, 2) a for loop which tests each element, 3) an if\n    conditions which tests that `x>y`, 4) a function which does some\n    magic, 5) a print statement which shows the result.  You can do\n    this even though you may not know yet how to code the individual\n    blocks.\n4.  **Start with what you know:** This is like writing an exam. Always\n    start with the pieces you already know how to solve. In doing so,\n    you may find important clues on how to solve the pieces you don't\n    know.\n5.  **Reduce the Problem:** Say you have to write a function which\n    converts any number into its binary notation. To simplify this\n    problem, you can state that your function will only deal with\n    positive integers. Or you can further simplify the problem to the\n    point that your function will only deal with numbers between 0 and\n    10 etc. Once you have an intermediate solution, you will have\n    gained much clarity on how to either solve the full problem, or\n    what specific questions to ask your peers or instructor.\n6.  **Look for Analogies:** Often you may be able to reduce your problem\n    in such away that you can recognize that you already solved a\n    similar problem elsewhere. Consider the case of strings, which are\n    just a specific type of lists. The exact commands may not match,\n    but now you probably remember how to query the methods associated\n    with a list object, or that you need to ask the specific question\n    of \"how do I replace the third element in a string\".\n7.  **Experiment:** Often it is useful to test the workings of a command\n    or code sequence in a separate cell.  The key techniques here are\n    the idea to isolate the code snippet from your main code, and to\n    test whether it actually does what you think it does. E.g.,\n    consider the following `a[3] :str` 4=. This may very well work in\n    your code, but it may not do what you expect. So a little\n    experiment can go a long way&#x2026; Similarly, with new commands, test\n    and explore their use elsewhere before adding them to your code.\n8.  **Don't get frustrated:** When you are frustrated, you won't think\n    clearly, and everything will take twice as long.  Take a walk,\n    rethink the problem (i.e. use the above steps), and come back to\n    the problem when you are ready. Then, you can try to reduce the\n    problem to it's most fundamental form, e.g., take the code out of\n    the function and run it in isolation, use print statements to\n    check whether your function parameters are indeed arriving inside\n    your function in the way you think. Once you have a minimal\n    example which show the problem, ask for help. Or if all else fail,\n    have a look at your plan and see if you can work on something\n    else.  To quote from Sprauls book:\n\n>     /When you allow yourself to get frustrated—and I use the word\n>     “allow” deliberately—you are, in effect, giving yourself an excuse\n>     to continue to fail. Suppose you’re working on a difficult problem\n>     and you feel your frustration rise. Hours later, you look back at\n>     an afternoon of gritted teeth and pencils snapped in anger and\n>     tell yourself that you would have made real progress if you had\n>     been able to calm down. In truth, you may have decided that giving\n>     in to your anger was easier than facing the difficult problem. \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["##### Assignment\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Create a new notebook in your submissions folder named\n\"Puzzles-FirstName-LastName\".
