They do look a bit cryptic, but are often quite\nuseful. Let's take a closer look to understand what happened here:\n\nWhen you hit `shift+enter` you send the commands you have typed into\nthe code cell to the python interpreter. This is just another computer\nprogram which will read your commands and try to make sense of\nit. Before running your code, the interpreter will do some sanity\nchecks, and in the above case, it finds that the variable \"A\" was\nnever defined. It thus prints:\n\n1.  a red line\n2.  the type of error, in this case \"NameError\", and some information\n    about the sequence how the errors are listed.\n3.  the type of input (ipython) and in which cell it occurred, followed\n    by the memory address and the module name (let's ignore this for\n    the moment)\n4.  the last couple of lines before the error occurred\n5.  the line where the error occurred\n6.  and if you are lucky some information why the error occurred\n\nIn your assignment, add a text cell below the code cell with the\nerror, with the following content (note, you create linebreaks by\nadding two spaces at the end of each line)\n\n    ErrorName  = \n    Input_Type =\n    Cell_number where error occurred = \n    Memory address where error occurred =\n    Module name where error occurred = \n    Line Number where error occurred = \n    Explanation of error type = \n\nand add the data you get from the actual error message after the equal\nsigns. If you have difficulties seeing the various elements above,\nplease talk to the TA or instructor\n\nOK, let's add another code cell and execute the following statement\n\n    a - b = 5\n\nyour mileage may vary (YMMV) but you may either get no result at all,\nor an error message. If you get no result, go to your Jupyter menu bar\nand select `Kernel -> Restart` and execute your cell again (a stuck\nprocess is often indicated by and asterisk on the left side of the\ncode cell).\n\nExplain in a text cell why you get an error. Then add a new code cell\nand execute this statement\n\n    a b = 5\n\nand explain why it fails.\n\nNext, execute this statement\n\n    f_g = 5\n\nExplain why this statement succeeds, and what are the values for f &\ng?\n\nLast but not least, add a final text cell, and write down what you\nlearned in this module.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Operator Precedence\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["You will probably remember from high school that it makes a difference\nwhether you write `2*(3+1)` or `(2*3)+1` because expressions with an\nexponent take precedence over multiplications or divisions, and those\ntake precedence over addition and subtractions.\n\nAdd one or more python cells populate them with code, which explores\nwhether the python interpreter is aware of those rules or not. One\ncell for each rule, and explain your results, and what you make of\nit. E.g., you can write when I execute `2*3+1` I get the result of 8,\nbut I should get 7.
