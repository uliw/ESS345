In your submissions folder, Create a new notebook with the headline\n    \"ESS345 Computational Geology: Variables\" You did create template\n    last time, so this should be straight forward, including the\n    notebook name and location. If not, this is now a good time to\n    speak up! \"Variables-Assignment-FirstName-LastName\". Probably\n    easiest to copy the one from the last exercise. And if you are\n    really smart, use this occasion to create a template for all future\n    submissions&#x2026;\n2.  Add Date\n3.  Add Student Id (probably easiest if you copy your notebook from the\n    previous exercise)\n4.  Add a text cell and cut copy past this text\n\n    Assume that \n    a = 4\n    \n    if you now write\n    a = a + 1\n\nwhat would you get if you were to execute print(a) afterward?  Please\nconsider this first without executing this.  Write down your expected\nresult, and explain why you expect this.\n\nNext, add a `python 3` cell to your notebook and execute the above,\nfollowed by a new text cell where you write down the expected value\nversus the observed value. Can you explain your results?  And if you\ncan't explain it, could you speculate? Please write down your\nthoughts.\n\nYou will probably remember from high school that it makes a difference\nwhether yo write `2*(3+1)` or `(2*3)+1` When coding, it is usually a\ngood idea to use brackets to clarify your intentions. However, you may\nalso remember that there are rules in which the operator takes\nprecedence. Expressions with an exponent take precedence over\nmultiplications or divisions, and those take precedence over addition\nand subtractions.\n\nAdd one or more python cells populate them with code, which explores\nwhether the python interpreter is aware of those rules or not. One\ncell for each rule, and explain your results, and what you make of\nit. E.g., you can write when I execute `2*3+1` I get the result of 8,\nbut I should get 7. Therefore I conclude that python is totally\nclueless about the fact that multiplications trump additions.\n\nExecute this code\n\n    a=4\n    b=5\n    c=10\n    a= (a/b)*c\n    print(a)\n\nand add a text cell below, and explain why \"a\" equals 8 and not 4 (it\nis not about the math!)\n\nLeft click on your code cell, and select the \"copy\" symbol from the\nmenu bar, left click on your text cell, and select the paste symbol\nfrom the menu bar to copy the code cell. In this new code cell,\nreplace `print(a)` with `print(A)` and execute your code. Please do so\nbefore you continue to read.\n\nAdd a text-cell and describe the results of your experiment. Are\nvariable names case specific or not? Mark your findings in **BOLD!**\n\nThis is (hopefully), also your first encounter with python-error\nmessages. They do look a bit cryptic, but are often quite\nuseful. Let's take a closer look to understand what happened here:\n\nWhen you hit `shift+enter` you send the commands you have typed into\nthe code cell to the python interpreter. This is just another computer\nprogram which will read your commands and try to make sense of\nit. Before running your code, the interpreter will do some sanity\nchecks, and in the above case, it finds that the variable \"A\" was\nnever defined. It thus prints:\n\n1.  a red line\n2.  the type of error, in this case \"NameError\", and some information\n    about the sequence how the errors are listed.\n3.  the type of input (ipython) and in which cell it occurred, followed\n    by the memory address and the module name (let's ignore this for\n    the moment)\n4.  the last couple of lines before the error occurred\n5.  the line where the error occurred\n6.  and if you are lucky some information why the error occurred.\n\nIn your assignment, add a text cell below the code cell with the error,\nwith the following content\n\n    ErrorName  = \n    Input_Type =\n    Cell_number where error occurred = \n    Memory address where error occurred =\n    Module name where error occurred = \n    Line Number where error occurred = \n    Explanation of error type = \n\nand add the data you get from the actual error message after the equal\nsigns.  If you have difficulties seeing the various elements above,\nplease talk to the TA or instructor\n\nOK, let's add another code cell and execute the following statement\n\n    a-b = 5\n\nyour mileage may vary (YMMV) but you may either get no result at all,\nor an error message. If you get no result, go to your menu bar and\nselect `Kernel -> Restart` and execute your cell again.\n\nExplain in a text cell why you get an error. Then add a new code cell\nand execute this statement\n\n    a b = 5\n\nand explain why it fails.\n\nLast but not least, execute this statement\n\n    f_g = 5\n\nExplain why this statement succeeds, and what are the values for f &\ng?\n\nLast but not least, add a final text cell, and write down what you\nlearned in this module.\n\nSave your notebook, download it in Notebook and pdf format, and submit\nboth on Quercus.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Marking scheme:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["1.  3 points if the filename follows the filename Template (capitalization, spaces, and dashes!)\n2.  2 points if your formatting is as requested\n3.  2 points if you have the correct (or internally consistent\n    explanation) of the above experiments (even if your expected result\n    is different from the one you obtained in the experiment)\n4.  2 points for each text cell with the correct explanation (10 pts\n    total)\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
