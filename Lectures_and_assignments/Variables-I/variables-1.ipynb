Before we proceed to learn the basics of data\nmanipulation, we need to understand how data is stored.\n\nOn its most basic level, a computer resembles a library (you have been\nto the library, right?). There are vast amounts of storage space, a\ncatalog where we can lookup where a specific book is stored, a\nlibrarian who will move books around and do other maintenance tasks,\nand a user who manipulates the information in those books, and who\nmight writes a new book which eventually goes back into the library.\n\nBooks can be found using a rather specific way of writing their\naddress in the library storage which, e.g., could read \n`QA76.17.C4672012`.\n\nSimilarly, information in a computer can be retrieved by using equally\ncryptic schemes, e.g., `0x5560b128f480`. The `0x` at the beginning\ntells us that this is a number to the base of 16, which after\nconversion into our 10 based system basically indicates that the\nrespective data is stored in the 93873777472640<sup>th</sup> memory\ncell. Clearly, it is cumbersome to keep these alphanumeric sequences\nin mind. This is where variables come into play. Rather then saying\nstore the number 4 at location `0x5560b128f480` we can simply say\n\"assign the value of 4 to the variable a\". Let's try this and execute\nthe following statement doing a left-click in the following cell, and\nhit `shift+enter`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = 4"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This will produce no output, but you will have assigned the value of 4\nto the variable `a`.

While there are\ncomputing environments which can do symbolic math, the above example\nis an entirely different beast. In symbolic math, the expression `a =\nb` is equal to the expression `b = a`. Not so in coding (try e.g., `a\n= 4` vs `4 = a`).  Remember, that writing `a = 4` means take the value\nof 4, store it into memory, and give this memory location the name\n\"a\". A better way to write this would be `a <- 4`.\n\nLikewise the expression `a+a` means retrieve the value stored at\nlocation \"a\" and do an addition with the value stored at location\n\"a\". So the \"a\" is merely a reference to a memory location.  Note that\nthere is nothing specific about calling this \"a\", You could equally\nwrite `myfirstvariablename = a` but it is a lot of typing\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Operators\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The `+` etc is called an operator.

In your submissions folder, create a new notebook, called\n    \"Variables-Assignment-FirstName-LastName\". Probably easiest to copy\n    the one from the last exercise.

Please\nconsider this first without executing this.  Write down your expected\nresult, and explain why you expect this.\n\nNext, add a `python 3` cell to your notebook, and execute the above,\nfollowed by new text cell where you write down the expected value\nversus the observed value. Can you explain your results?  And if you\ncan't explain it, could you speculate? Please write down your\nthoughts.\n\nYou will probably remember from high school that it makes a difference\nwhether yo write `2*(3+1)` or `(2*3)+1` When coding, it is usually a\ngood idea to use brackets to clarify your intentions. However, you may\nalso remember that there are rules which operator takes\nprecedence. Expressions with an exponent take precedence over\nmultiplications or divisions, and those take precedence over addition\nand subtractions.\n\nAdd one or more python cells populate them with code which explores\nwhether the python interpreter is aware of those rules or not. One\ncell for each rule, and explain your results, and what you make of\nit. E.g. you can write when I execute `2*3+1` I get the result of 8,\nbut I should get 7. Therefore I conclude that python is totally\nclueless about the fact that multiplications trump additions.\n\nSave your notebook, download it in Notebook format, and submit\nQuercus.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Marking scheme:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["1.  3 points if the filename follows the file-name Template (capitalization, spaces, and dashes!)\n2.  2 points if your formatting is as requested\n3.  2 points if you have the correct (or internally consistent\n    explanation) of the above experiment (even if your expected result\n    was different from the one you obtained in the experiment)\n4.  2 points if you have tests and explanations for the operator\n    precedence experiment.\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
