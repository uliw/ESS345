Before we proceed to learn the basics of data\nmanipulation, we need to understand how data is stored.\n\nOn its most basic level, a computer resembles a library (you have been\nto the library, right?). There are vast amounts of storage space, a\ncatalog where we can lookup where a specific book is stored, a\nlibrarian who will move books around and do other maintenance tasks,\nand a user who manipulates the information in those books, and who\nmight writes a new book which eventually goes back into the library.\n\nBooks can be found using a rather specific way of writing their\naddress in the library storage which, e.g., could read \n`QA76.17.C4672012`.\n\nSimilarly, information in a computer can be retrieved by using equally\ncryptic schemes, e.g., `0x5560b128f480`. This is a so number to the\nbase of 16, which basically indicates that the respective data is\nstored in the 93873777472640<sup>th</sup> memory cell. Clearly, it is cumbersome\nto keep these alphanumeric sequences in mind. This is where variables\ncome into play. Rather then saying store the number 4 at location\n`0x5560b128f480` we can simply say \"assign the value of 4 to the\nvariable a\". Let's try this and execute the following statement doing\na left-click in the following cell, and hit `shift+enter`\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["a = 4"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This will produce no output, but you will have assigned the value of 4\nto the variable `a`. Let's verify that this assignment did succeed. We\ncan do so asking the python interpreter to print the value\nof a.

While there are\ncomputing environments which can do symbolic math, the above is an\nentirely different beast. In symbolic math, the expression `a = b` is\nequal to the expression `b = a`. Not so in coding (try e.g., `a = 4`\nvs `4 = a`).  Remember, that writing `a = 4` means take the value of\n4, store it into memory, and give this memory location the name \"a\". A\nbetter way to write this would be `a <-- 4`.\n\nLikewise the expression `a+a` means retrieve the value stored at\nlocation \"a\" and add it to the value stored at location \"a\". So the\n\"a\" is merely a reference to a memory location.  Note that there is\nnothing specific about calling this \"a\", You could equally write\n`myfirstvariablename = a` but it is a lot of typing\n\nSo by now, you have learned two very fundamental processes:\n\n1.  Assigning a label and value to a memory location\n2.  Retrieving value from a memory location using the label as\n    reference\n\nGo forth, and solve this assignment:\n\n1.  Create a new notebook, called\n    \"Variables-Assignment-FirstName-LastName\"\n2.  Add a title like this \"Variables Assignment FirstName LastName\"\n3.  Date\n4.  Student Id (probably easiest if you copy your notebook from the\n    previous exercise)\n5.  Add a text cell and cut copy past this text\n\n    Assume that \n    a = 4\n    \n    if you now write\n    a = a + 1\n    \n    what would you get if you execute print(a) afterwards?\n    Please consider this first without executing this. \n    Write down your expected result, and explain why you expect this.\n\n1.  add a `python 3` cell to your notebook, and execute the above\n2.  add a another text cell, and write down the expected value vs the\n    observed value. If they are different, can you explain why? And if\n    you can't explain it, could you speculate? Please write down your\n    thoughts, and submit this notebook on quercus.\n\nMarking scheme:\n\n1.  3 points if the filename follows the file-name Template (capitalization, spaces, and dashes!)\n2.  2 points if the content is as requested.\n3.  2 points if you have the correct (or internally consistent\n    explanation) of the above experiment (even if your expected result\n    was different from the one you obtained in the experiment)\n\n\n[literatur/journals-new.bib,literatur/new.bib,literatur/uli.bib,literatur/uli-with-students.bib](literatur/journals-new.bib,literatur/new.bib,literatur/uli.bib,literatur/uli-with-students.bib)\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
